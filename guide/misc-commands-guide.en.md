Auxiliary commands for maintenance, release, and spec management in Maestro workflows.

---

## 1. maestro-amend — Incremental Patching

Signal-driven Overlay generator. Collects workflow defect signals from multiple sources, diagnoses which commands need amendments, and batch-generates targeted Overlay patches. All modifications go through the Overlay system (`~/.maestro/overlays/*.json`) — no changes to original command files, idempotent and persists across reinstalls.

Unlike `/maestro-overlay` (explicit single creation), `/maestro-amend` automatically **discovers** what needs fixing by analyzing workflow artifacts.

### Use Cases

- `/maestro-execute` built-in verification gate (E2.7) exposed missing command steps
- `/quality-review` identified process-level deficiencies
- Workflow execution deviations traced to incomplete command definitions
- Issue tracking shows recurring problems rooted in command design

### Signal Sources

| Flag | Source | What It Collects |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| `--from-verify <dir>` | verification.json | Workflow gaps from verification failures |
| `--from-review <dir>` | review.json | Process defects from code review |
| `--from-session <id>` | Session artifacts | Issues encountered during execution |
| `--from-issues ISS-xxx,...` | issues.jsonl | Issues traced to command defects |
| `--scan` | Auto-scan .workflow/ | All workflow-related signals |
| _(Positional text)_ | User description | Direct observations |

### Workflow

```
Collect Signals → Diagnose & Classify → Group & Plan → Preview & Confirm → Generate Overlay → Install
```

1. **Collect Signals**: Extract and classify as "command defect" or "code bug"
2. **Diagnose & Map**: Determine target command, section, and patch mode
3. **Group & Plan**: Group by command + section, display injection points
4. **Preview & Confirm**: User confirms or edits the injection point map
5. **Generate & Install**: Generate Overlay JSON files and install via `maestro overlay add`

### Common Usage

```bash
/maestro-amend --from-verify .workflow/phases/1     # Discover gaps from verification
/maestro-amend --from-review .workflow/phases/2      # Extract process improvements
/maestro-amend --scan                                # Auto-scan all signals
/maestro-amend "maestro-execute missing CLI verification step"  # Describe directly
/maestro-amend --dry-run                             # Preview mode (no install)
/maestro-amend -y                                    # Skip confirmation
```

## 2. maestro-update — Update Check

Detects `.workflow/` schema version, displays available migration plans, and executes upgrades step by step. Supports incremental chain upgrades (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0).

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview migration plan only |
| `--force` | Skip confirmation, apply all pending migrations |

### Execution Flow

```
Detect Version → Preview Plan → Step-by-Step Confirm → Execute Migration → Summary Report
```

### Common Usage

```bash
/maestro-update --dry-run   # Check for pending migrations
/maestro-update             # Interactive step-by-step upgrade
/maestro-update --force     # One-command full upgrade
```

### Notes

- Skipping a step may break the version chain (system warns)
- Backup created before each migration: `.workflow/state.json.backup-v{from}-{timestamp}`
- Manual restore: `cp .workflow/state.json.backup-v{from}-{ts} .workflow/state.json`

---

## 3. spec-remove — Spec Removal

Removes a specified `<spec-entry>` from specs files. Symmetric counterpart to `/spec-add`, using `maestro wiki remove-entry` for atomic deletion with automatic index updates.

### Entry ID Format

```
spec-{file-stem}-{NNN}  (e.g., spec-learnings-003)
```

### Common Usage

```bash
maestro wiki list --type spec --json    # List all spec entries
/spec-load --keyword auth               # Search by keyword
/spec-remove spec-learnings-003          # Remove specific entry
```

### Notes

- Requires `.workflow/specs/` initialized via `/spec-setup`
- Entry ID must be a spec type child node
- Removal is irreversible (preview with `/spec-load` first)

---

## 4. maestro-milestone-release — Milestone Release

Packages a completed milestone as a releasable version. Performs semver bumping, generates Changelog, creates annotated git tag, and optionally pushes to remote. Final SDLC delivery step.

### Prerequisites

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Milestone completed | `/maestro-milestone-complete` executed |
| Audit passed | Audit report verdict is PASS |
| Clean workspace | No uncommitted changes (except `--dry-run`) |

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<version>` | Explicitly specify version |
| `--bump patch\|minor\|major` | Increment version (default: `minor`) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview only, no writes |
| `--no-tag` | Skip git tag |
| `--no-push` | Skip push |

### Release Flow

```
Verify Prerequisites → Resolve Version → Collect Changes → Generate Changelog → Write Version → Create Tag → Push
```

### Milestone Lifecycle

```
/maestro-milestone-complete → /maestro-milestone-audit → /maestro-milestone-release
```

Order cannot be reversed: complete produces summary → audit validates → release publishes.

### Common Usage

```bash
/maestro-milestone-release                  # Standard release (minor bump)
/maestro-milestone-release --bump patch     # Patch version
/maestro-milestone-release 2.0.0            # Explicit version
/maestro-milestone-release --dry-run        # Preview only
/maestro-milestone-release --no-push        # Release without pushing
```

### Notes

- If manifest file doesn't exist, manually specify version and use `--no-tag`
- Push failure: manually run `git push --follow-tags`
- `--dry-run` writes nothing and creates no tags
