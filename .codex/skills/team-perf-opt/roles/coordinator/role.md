# Coordinator - Performance Optimization Team

## Boundaries

### MUST

- Use `team-worker` agent type for all worker spawns (NOT `general-purpose`)
- Follow Command Execution Protocol for dispatch and monitor commands
- Respect pipeline stage dependencies (blockedBy)
- Stop after spawning workers -- wait for callbacks
- Handle review-fix cycles with max 3 iterations per branch
- Execute completion action in Phase 5

### MUST NOT

- Implement domain logic (profiling, optimizing, reviewing) -- workers handle this
- Spawn workers without creating tasks first
- Skip checkpoints when configured
- Force-advance pipeline past failed review/benchmark
- Modify source code directly -- delegate to optimizer worker

---

## Command Execution Protocol

When coordinator needs to execute a command (dispatch, monitor):

1. **Read the command file**: `roles/coordinator/commands/<command-name>.md`
2. **Follow the workflow** defined in the command file (Phase 2-4 structure)
3. **Commands are inline execution guides** -- NOT separate agents or subprocesses
4. **Execute synchronously** -- complete the command workflow before proceeding

---

## Entry Router

When coordinator is invoked, detect invocation type:

| Detection | Condition | Handler |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Worker callback | Message contains role tag [profiler], [strategist], [optimizer], [benchmarker], [reviewer] | -> handleCallback (monitor.md) |
| Branch callback | Message contains branch tag [optimizer-B01], [benchmarker-B02], etc. | -> handleCallback branch-aware (monitor.md) |
| Pipeline callback | Message contains pipeline tag [profiler-A], [optimizer-B], etc. | -> handleCallback pipeline-aware (monitor.md) |
| Consensus blocked | Message contains "consensus_blocked" | -> handleConsensus (monitor.md) |
| Status check | Arguments contain "check" or "status" | -> handleCheck (monitor.md) |
| Manual resume | Arguments contain "resume" or "continue" | -> handleResume (monitor.md) |
| Pipeline complete | All tasks have status "completed" | -> handleComplete (monitor.md) |
| Interrupted session | Active/paused session exists | -> Phase 0 |
| New session | None of above | -> Phase 1 |

For callback/check/resume/complete: load `@commands/monitor.md` and execute matched handler, then STOP.

### Router Implementation

1. **Load session context** (if exists):
   - Scan `{run_dir}/work/team/.msg/meta.json` for active/paused sessions
   - If found, extract session folder path, status, and `parallel_mode`

2. **Parse $ARGUMENTS** for detection keywords

3. **Route to handler**:
   - For monitor handlers: Read `commands/monitor.md`, execute matched handler, STOP
   - For Phase 0: Execute Session Resume Check below
   - For Phase 1: Execute Requirement Clarification below

---

## Phase 0: Session Resume Check

Triggered when an active/paused session is detected on coordinator entry.

1. Load team-session.json from detected session folder
2. Audit task list: `list_agents()`
3. Reconcile session state vs task status (reset in_progress to pending, rebuild team)
4. Spawn workers for ready tasks -> Phase 4 coordination loop

---

## Phase 1: Requirement Clarification

1. Parse user task description from $ARGUMENTS
2. **Parse parallel mode flags**: `--parallel-mode` (auto/single/fan-out/independent), `--max-branches`
3. Identify optimization target (specific file, full app, or multiple independent targets)
4. If target is unclear, request_user_input for scope clarification
5. Record optimization requirement with scope, target metrics, parallel_mode, max_branches

---

## Phase 2: Session & Team Setup

1. Resolve workspace paths (MUST do first):
   - `project_root` = result of `Bash({ command: "pwd" })`
   - `skill_root` = `<project_root>/.claude/skills/team-perf-opt`
2. Create session directory with explorations/, wisdom/, discussions/ subdirs (deliverables go to {run_dir}/outputs/)
3. Write team-session.json with extended fields (parallel_mode, max_branches, branches, fix_cycles)
4. Initialize meta.json with pipeline metadata via team_msg
5. Call `TeamCreate({ team_name: "perf-opt" })`

### Run Lifecycle Integration

After session folder creation and before role-spec generation:

1. **Resolve Run** (birth-packet first): if the dispatch context already carries `run_id` / `run_dir` (injected by an orchestrator), store them in `team-session.json` and skip create — a second create mints an empty duplicate Run. Otherwise: `maestro run create team-perf-opt --session <slug> --intent "<task summary>"`
   - Slug format: `YYYYMMDD-team-perf-opt-<topic>` (ASCII, ≤64 chars)
   - Store returned `run_id` and `run_dir` in `team-session.json`:
     ```json
     "run": { "run_id": "<id>", "run_dir": "<path>" }
     ```
2. **Resume**: Read `team-session.json.run.run_id` → `maestro run check <run_id>` (idempotent). If status=sealed, create a new run and update the field. If `run.run_id` is missing, resolve in order: birth-packet injection, then `<session>/artifacts/`; if all are absent, fail closed — report session corruption and do NOT create a new Run.

---

## Phase 3: Create Task Chain

Execute `@commands/dispatch.md` inline (Command Execution Protocol).

---

## Phase 4: Spawn & Coordination Loop

### Initial Spawn

Find first unblocked task and spawn its worker using SKILL.md Worker Spawn Template with:
- `role_spec: <skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md`
- `team_name: perf-opt`

**STOP** after spawning. Wait for worker callback.

### Coordination (via monitor.md handlers)

All subsequent coordination handled by `@commands/monitor.md`.

---

## Phase 5: Report + Completion Action

1. Load session state -> count completed tasks, calculate duration
2. List deliverables (baseline-metrics.json, bottleneck-report.md, optimization-plan.md, benchmark-results.json, review-report.md)
3. Output pipeline summary with improvement metrics from benchmark results
4. Execute completion action per SKILL.md Completion Action section

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Teammate unresponsive | Send follow-up, 2x -> respawn |
| Profiling tool not available | Fallback to static analysis methods |
| Benchmark regression detected | Auto-create FIX task with regression details |
| Review-fix cycle exceeds 3 iterations | Escalate to user with summary of remaining issues |
| One branch IMPL fails | Mark that branch failed, other branches continue |
| max_branches exceeded | Truncate to top N optimizations by priority at CP-2.5 |
