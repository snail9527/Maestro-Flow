<purpose>
Wave-based multi-dimensional analysis using `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Diamond topology:
Wave 1 (CLI exploration, parallel) -> Wave 2 (6-dimension scoring, parallel) -> Wave 3 (decision synthesis).

**Tri-depth**: Full mode (all 3 waves), Quick mode (`-q`, Wave 3 only), Gaps mode (`--gaps`, issue root cause pipeline).
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- phase number, topic text, and optional flags.

**Flags**:
- `-y, --yes`: Skip all confirmations (auto mode)
- `-c, --concurrency N`: Max concurrent agents per wave (default: 6)
- `--continue`: Resume existing session
- `-q, --quick`: Skip exploration + scoring, Wave 3 only
- `--gaps [ISS-ID]`: Issue root cause analysis. If ISS-ID: single issue. If omitted: all open/registered from issues.jsonl.

**Session**: `.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-analyze-{slug}/`
**Output**: tasks.csv, results.csv, discoveries.ndjson, context.md (all modes), analysis.md + conclusions.json (full mode only)

**Column semantics**:
- Input: id (unique string), title, description (detailed agent instructions), dimension (architecture/implementation/performance/feasibility/impact/risk/complexity/alignment/maintainability/synthesis), analysis_type (explore/score/decide), deps (semicolon-sep task IDs), context_from (IDs whose findings this task needs), wave (1=explore, 2=score, 3=decide)
- Output: status (pending->completed/failed/skipped), findings (key summary, max 500 chars), score (0-100 for scoring tasks, empty for explore/decide), recommendations, confidence_score (0-100 per dimension), error

Wave 1: N exploration rows (parallel). Wave 2: 6 scoring rows (parallel). Wave 3: 1 synthesis row.
Quick mode: 1 synthesis row only. Gaps mode: 1 row per issue (W1) + 1 per group (W2).

Available exploration dimensions: architecture, implementation, performance, security, concept, comparison, decision, external_research.

<invariants>
1. **Wave order sacred**: Never execute wave N+1 before wave N completes
2. **CSV is source of truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
3. **Context propagation**: prev_context from master CSV, not memory
4. **Discovery board append-only**: Never modify/delete discoveries.ndjson
5. **Quick mode shortcut**: -q generates only wave 3 task
6. **Gaps mode pipeline**: --gaps follows: Load issues from issues.jsonl -> Classify & group by location/component -> CSV gen (W1: 1 explore row per issue, W2: 1 synthesis per group) -> Execute waves -> Write issue.analysis record per issue -> Append history `{ action: "analyzed", at: <ISO>, by: "maestro-analyze --gaps" }` -> Output context.md for plan --gaps
7. **Graceful degradation**: Missing exploration reduces scoring quality; missing scoring reduces synthesis quality
8. **Tri-output**: context.md always. analysis.md + conclusions.json full-mode only. Gaps mode writes to issues.jsonl + context.md

<actions>

### A_SPAWN_WAVE_1

Filter wave==1 -> write wave-1.csv -> `spawn_agents_on_csv({ csv_path, max_concurrency })`.

**Exploration agent** (3-layer per dimension):
1. Module Discovery (breadth): keyword search, relevant files, module boundaries
2. Structure Tracing (depth): top 3-5 files, call chains 2-3 levels, data flow
3. Code Anchor Extraction (detail): code snippet 20-50 lines with file:line per finding

Share via discovery board. Merge results -> master tasks.csv.

### A_SPAWN_WAVE_2

Filter wave==2 -> build prev_context from wave 1 findings -> write wave-2.csv -> spawn.

**Scoring agent** (6 dimensions: feasibility, impact, risk, complexity, alignment, maintainability):
Score 0-100 with specific evidence (code refs from exploration). Each score MUST reference exploration findings.

Merge results -> master tasks.csv.

### A_SPAWN_WAVE_3

Filter wave==3 -> build prev_context from wave 2 scores (or project context for quick mode) -> spawn.

**Synthesis agent**:
- Full mode: analysis.md (executive summary, per-dimension scores, risk matrix, Go/No-Go), context.md (Locked/Free/Deferred decisions), conclusions.json
- Quick mode: context.md only from available project context
- Gaps mode: per-issue analysis records -> issues.jsonl + context.md for plan --gaps

Gray area detection: domain-aware (things users SEE/CALL/RUN/READ), phase-specific (skip prior decided areas).

### A_AGGREGATE_RESULTS

1. Export results.csv
2. **Confidence scoring** (full mode): factors -- findings_depth(.30), evidence_strength(.25), coverage_breadth(.20), user_validation(.15), consistency(.10). Thresholds: <60% deeper, 60-80% optional, 80-95% converging, >95% converge.
3. Auto-create issues from Deferred items -> issues.jsonl
4. Spec enrichment: Locked decisions -> `maestro spec add arch`; code patterns -> `maestro spec add coding`
5. Register artifact in state.json (type: analyze)
6. Copy outputs to scratchDir, display summary
7. **Next-step routing**:

   | Scope | Condition | Next |
   |-------|-----------|------|
   | Phase/Milestone | Go + UI work needed | `$maestro-impeccable build {target}` |
   | Phase/Milestone | Go + ready to plan | `$maestro-plan` or `$maestro-plan {phase}` |
   | Phase/Milestone | No-Go | `$maestro-brainstorm {topic}` |
   | Adhoc/Standalone | Ready to plan | `$maestro-plan --dir {scratch_dir}` |
   | Adhoc/Standalone | Need more exploration | `$maestro-analyze {topic} --continue` |
   | Gaps | Issues analyzed | `$maestro-plan --gaps` |
   | Gaps | Need more context | `$maestro-analyze --gaps {ISS-ID}` |
