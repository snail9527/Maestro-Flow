description: Generate milestone/phase roadmap from requirements or upstream context

<purpose>
Generate a milestone/phase roadmap using `spawn_agents_on_csv` with 2-wave analysis:

Wave 1: parallel analysis (scope, risk, dependency). Wave 2: assembly -> roadmap.md with Milestone > Phase hierarchy.

Additional: `--revise` (modify existing roadmap), `--review` (read-only health check).

For formal specification documents (Product Brief, PRD, Architecture, Epics), use `maestro-blueprint` instead.
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- requirement/idea text or @file reference, plus optional flags.

**Flags**:
- `-y, --yes`: Skip all confirmations
- `-m progressive|direct|auto`: Decomposition strategy (default: auto)
- `--phases N`: Target phase count
- `--revise [instructions]`: Revise existing roadmap preserving completed phases
- `--review`: Read-only roadmap health assessment
- `--from <source>`: Load upstream context package (brainstorm:ID, blueprint:BLP-xxx, analyze:ANL-xxx, @file, or path)
- `--from-brainstorm SESSION-ID`: (backward compat alias for `--from brainstorm:ID`)

**Session**: `.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-roadmap-{slug}/`
**Output**: tasks.csv, results.csv, discoveries.ndjson, context.md, `.workflow/roadmap.md`
</context>

<interview_protocol>
Interview the user relentlessly until shared understanding is reached. Active only in interactive mode; skip when `-y/--yes`, `--revise`, `--review`, `-c`, or input is already specific (clear requirement + mode).

- One decision per turn via request_user_input with 2–4 options + a (Recommended) default. The user controls termination — keep interviewing until convergence; they can interrupt naturally at any time.
- Search-first when uncertain: before asking, resolve via `state.json`, existing `roadmap.md`, `project.md`, `maestro spec load`, `maestro wiki search`, Glob/Grep/Read, or — for open-ended multi-file scans — `maestro delegate ... --role explore`. Never ask what code or memory can verify; never bounce your own ambiguity back to the user — search first, then ask only what truly needs human judgment.
- Writeback cadence: each settled decision is immediately appended/updated in the `Roadmap Decisions` section at the top of `.workflow/roadmap.md` (create the section if absent). Do NOT batch writeback to the end — partial decisions must already be on disk before the next question.
- Walk the decision dependency tree strictly: mode → requirement scope → decomposition strategy → phase dependencies/order. Do not open the next branch until the current one is settled.
- Scope guard: only decide the shape of the roadmap. Do not pre-resolve intra-phase task breakdown — that belongs to `plan`.

Decision points: scope (MVP / complete / phased) → strategy (progressive / direct / auto) → milestone boundaries → phase dependencies and order.

Exit: on consensus or explicit user signal to proceed, finalize the `Roadmap Decisions` section (rows already populated incrementally). Schema:
`| # | Decision | Choice | Source (user / code / default) |`

### tasks.csv

```csv
id,title,description,analysis_focus,deps,context_from,wave,status,findings,error
"1","Scope Analysis","Identify features, MVP boundaries, must-have vs nice-to-have, size estimates.","scope","","","1","","",""
"2","Risk Analysis","Technical/project risks, unknowns, feasibility, risk levels, mitigations.","risk","","","1","","",""
"3","Dependency Analysis","Feature dependencies, ordering constraints, parallel-safe groups, external deps.","dependency","","","1","","",""
"4","Roadmap Assembly","Synthesize findings into roadmap.md: Milestone > Phase hierarchy, success criteria.","","1;2;3","1;2;3","2","","",""
```

**Column semantics**:
- Input: id (unique string), title, description (detailed instructions), analysis_focus (scope/risk/dependency), deps (semicolon-sep IDs), context_from (IDs whose findings needed), wave (1=analysis, 2=assembly)
- Output: status (pending->completed/failed/skipped), findings (max 500 chars), error

Wave 1: 3 analysis rows (parallel). Wave 2: 1 assembly row.
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Wave order sacred**: Never execute wave 2 before wave 1 completes
2. **CSV is source of truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
3. **Context propagation**: prev_context from master CSV, not memory
4. **Discovery board append-only**: Never modify/delete discoveries.ndjson
5. **Graceful degradation**: Wave 1 fails -> Wave 2 proceeds with seed input only

### Shared Spawn Contract (W1 and W2)

Every `spawn_agents_on_csv` call MUST filter `wave==N AND status=="pending"` and use this strict JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id":            { "type": "string" },
    "result_status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["completed", "failed", "blocked"] },
    "findings":      { "type": "string", "maxLength": 500 },
    "output_path":   { "type": "string", "description": "W2 only: absolute path of roadmap.md (empty for W1 agents that just return findings)" },
    "error":         { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["id", "result_status", "findings"]
}
```

Merge: `result_status` → master `status`; copy `findings`, `output_path`, `error`.

**Shared termination contract** (embed in every instruction):
```
You MUST call report_agent_job_result EXACTLY ONCE before exiting.
- Success → result_status=completed (W2: roadmap.md MUST exist on disk)
- Failure → result_status=failed with error message
- Blocked → upstream context insufficient → result_status=blocked
- Timeout → near max_runtime_seconds → result_status=blocked, error="timeout"
- NEVER continue indefinitely. NEVER exit silently. NEVER omit the call.
Do NOT write to tasks.csv, wave-*.csv, results.csv. Do NOT call spawn_agents_on_csv (no recursion).
```

### A_SPAWN_WAVE_1

Filter `wave==1 AND status=="pending"` -> write wave-1.csv -> spawn.

**Agents**: scope analysis (feature inventory + priority), risk analysis (unknowns + mitigations), dependency analysis (dependency graph + critical path). Read-only.

Merge results -> master tasks.csv.

### A_SPAWN_WAVE_2

Filter `wave==2 AND status=="pending"`. Build prev_context from wave 1. Inject strategy + `--phases` constraint. Spawn.

Assembly agent produces roadmap.md with Milestone > Phase hierarchy (goal, depends-on, requirements, success criteria), scope decisions. Verifies roadmap.md on disk before reporting completed.

**Strategy selection** via uncertainty assessment (5 factors):
| Factor | Low | Medium | High |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Scope clarity | explicit | some ambiguity | vague/open-ended |
| Technical risk | proven stack | some unknowns | new technology |
| Dependency unknown | all mapped | some unclear | many external |
| Domain familiarity | expert | moderate | new domain |
| Requirement stability | locked | some flux | evolving |

>=3 high -> progressive, >=3 low -> direct, else -> ask (or auto if -y).

### A_AGGREGATE_RESULTS

1. Export results.csv
2. Interactive refinement (max 3 rounds, skip if -y): Approve / Refine / Regenerate
3. Generate context.md (summary + analysis findings + roadmap stats)
4. Write .workflow/roadmap.md with Milestone > Phase hierarchy
5. Update state.json milestones + current_milestone
6. Next-step routing: need analysis -> maestro-analyze; ready to plan -> maestro-plan; UI first -> maestro-impeccable build; need formal specs -> maestro-blueprint
