<purpose>
Wave-based parallel task execution using `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Reads plan.json to build a CSV where waves are pre-computed from the plan. Each wave runs tasks in parallel, with cross-wave context propagation via `prev_context`. This is the core execution engine of the maestro pipeline.

**Core workflow**: Load Plan -> Build CSV from Tasks -> Wave-by-Wave Parallel Execution -> Aggregate Results

## Iron Law

**VERIFY EACH TASK OUTPUT BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE.** Every task needs convergence criteria checks — no task may be marked "completed" based on agent self-report alone.

## Red Flags — These Thoughts Mean STOP
- "The agent said it's done, so it must be done" / "I'll batch-verify all tasks at the end"
- "This task is too simple to need verification" / "Let me mark it complete and fix later"
All mean: **run convergence criteria check NOW**.

**Topology**: Custom (waves inherited from plan.json -- no Kahn's algorithm needed)

**Columns**:

| Column | Phase | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Input | Task ID (TASK-NNN format, from plan.json) |
| `title` | Input | Short task title from task definition |
| `description` | Input | Full task description from TASK-*.json |
| `scope` | Input | Target file/directory glob from task.files |
| `convergence_criteria` | Input | Grep-verifiable completion criteria (semicolon-separated) |
| `hints` | Input | Implementation hints + reference files from task definition |
| `execution_directives` | Input | Verification commands to run after implementation |
| `deps` | Input | Semicolon-separated dependency task IDs |
| `context_from` | Input | Semicolon-separated task IDs whose findings this task needs |
| `wave` | Computed | Wave number from plan.json wave assignment |
| `status` | Output | `pending` -> `completed` / `failed` / `blocked` / `skipped` (mapped from output_schema `result_status`) |
| `findings` | Output | Implementation notes and observations (max 500 chars) |
| `files_modified` | Output | Semicolon-separated list of created/modified files |
| `tests_passed` | Output | Test pass/fail status from execution_directives |
| `error` | Output | Error message if failed or blocked |

**Column separation rule**: Wave CSV (input to spawn_agents_on_csv) and output_schema MUST NOT share column names. Wave CSV only contains Input columns + prev_context. Output columns are returned exclusively via output_schema (using `result_status`, not `status`). During merge, `result_status` maps back to the master CSV's `status` column.

### Per-Wave CSV (Temporary)

Each wave generates `wave-{N}.csv` with extra `prev_context` column populated from predecessor task findings.

### Output Artifacts

| File | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `tasks.csv` | Master state -- all tasks with status/findings | Updated after each wave |
| `wave-{N}.csv` | Per-wave input (temporary) | Created before wave, deleted after |
| `wave-{N}-results.csv` | Per-wave output (uses `result_status`) | Created by spawn_agents_on_csv, deleted after merge |
| `results.csv` | Final export of all task results | Created in Phase 3 |
| `discoveries.ndjson` | Shared exploration board | Append-only, carries across waves |
| `context.md` | Human-readable execution report | Created in Phase 3 |

### Session Structure

```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-execute-P{N}-{slug}/
+-- tasks.csv
+-- results.csv
+-- discoveries.ndjson
+-- context.md
+-- config.json
+-- wave-{N}.csv (temporary)
+-- wave-{N}-results.csv (temporary)
```
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization, then Phase 1
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Never execute wave N+1 before wave N completes and results are merged
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all execution state
4. **Context Propagation**: prev_context built from master CSV findings, not from memory
5. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear, modify, or recreate discoveries.ndjson
6. **Cascading Skip on Failure**: If a task fails/blocks, all dependent tasks are skipped
7. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Remove `wave-{N}.csv` AND `wave-{N}-results.csv` after results are merged
8. **Max 3 Fix Attempts**: Per task, auto-fix convergence failures up to 3 times, then mark blocked
9. **Breakpoint Resume**: Always detect completed tasks and skip them on re-run
10. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution until all waves complete or user explicitly stops
</invariants>

<execution>

### Session Initialization

```
Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
  AUTO_YES        ← --yes | -y
  continueMode    ← --continue
  maxConcurrency  ← --concurrency | -c N  (default: 5)
  autoCommit      ← --auto-commit
  executionMethod ← --method agent|cli  (default: from config.json)
  scratchDir      ← --dir <path>  (default: null)
  phaseArg        ← remaining text after flag removal

Derive:
  dateStr        ← UTC+8 YYYYMMDD
  sessionId      ← scratchDir ? "{dateStr}-execute-scratch" : "{dateStr}-execute-P{phaseArg}-{phaseSlug}"
  sessionFolder  ← ".workflow/.csv-wave/{sessionId}"

mkdir -p {sessionFolder}
```

### Pre-flight: Team Conflict Check

Before any task execution, run:
```
Bash("maestro collab preflight --phase <phase-number>")
```
If exit code is 1, present warnings and ask whether to proceed.

### Phase 1: Plan Resolution -> CSV

**Objective**: Resolve phase, load plan + task definitions, detect resume point, generate tasks.csv.

**Decomposition Rules**:

1. **Plan resolution** (per scratch-milestone-architecture):

| Input | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `--dir <path>` | Use path directly (scratch plan dir); scope=standalone |
| No args | Find all pending plans for current milestone from state.json.artifacts[] |
| Number (e.g., `3`) | Find pending plans for phase N from state.json.artifacts[]; **resolve milestone via D-007 reverse lookup** |

   For multi-plan: execute sequentially. Each plan is a full CSV session.

   **D-007 milestone reverse lookup** (numeric arg only):
   ```
   resolve_milestone(phase_number):
     for ms in state.json.milestones[]:
       if str(phase_number) in ms.phase_slugs: return ms.id
     return state.json.current_milestone   # fallback
   ```
   Use the resolved milestone for EXC artifact registration (`milestone` field) and artifact filtering. NEVER read `current_milestone` directly for phase-scoped runs — phase N may belong to a milestone different from current.

2. **Load plan**: Read `{PLAN_DIR}/plan.json` for wave structure and task assignments

3. **Detect completed tasks (breakpoint resume)**: Read `.task/TASK-{NNN}.json` for each task; exclude completed ones from CSV. Log resume count.

4. **Build tasks.csv**: For each pending task per wave, read `.task/TASK-{NNN}.json` and extract: title, description, scope (from files), convergence.criteria, hints, execution_directives. Set `deps` from task dependency, `context_from` = deps, `wave` from plan.json.

5. **Load project specs + tools**: Run `maestro spec load --category coding` to load coding conventions, architecture constraints, AND discoverable knowhow tools (passed to all agents)

6. **Load UI specs (conditional)**: If any task involves frontend/UI work (task scope/description contains component, page, style, layout, CSS, HTML, frontend; or focus_paths in `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/styles/`, `src/ui/`), also run `maestro spec load --category ui` and include in agent context.

7. **Load codebase + wiki context** (optional, passed to all agents):
   - If `.workflow/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` exists: read and include as `codebase_context` in agent instructions
   - Run `maestro wiki search "<phase keywords>" --json 2>/dev/null`; if results: include top 5 entries as `wiki_context`
   - Both are optional — proceed without if unavailable

7. **User validation**: Display task/wave breakdown. Skip if AUTO_YES.

8. **TDD plan detection**: If `plan.json.tdd_mode == true`, enable TDD execution enforcement:
   - RED tasks (meta.tdd_phase=red): after completion, verify test exists AND fails. If test passes → mark BLOCKED "Test passes before implementation — wrong test".
   - GREEN tasks (meta.tdd_phase=green): after completion, verify ALL tests pass. If RED test still fails → mark BLOCKED.
   - REFACTOR tasks (meta.tdd_phase=refactor): after completion, verify ALL tests still pass. If any fails → undo, mark BLOCKED.

### Phase 2: Wave Execution Engine

**Objective**: Execute tasks wave-by-wave via spawn_agents_on_csv with cross-wave context propagation.

#### Per-Wave Execution Loop

For each wave N in ascending order:

1. Extract wave N pending rows from master `tasks.csv` (skip wave if none)
2. Build `prev_context` per task from completed predecessor findings
3. Write `wave-{N}.csv` with `prev_context` column, then execute:

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-${N}.csv`,    // only rows where wave==N AND status=="pending"
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: EXECUTOR_INSTRUCTION,              // see "Executor Worker Contract" below
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency,
  max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-${N}-results.csv`,
  output_schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      id:             { type: "string" },
      result_status:  { type: "string", enum: ["completed", "failed", "blocked"] },
      findings:       { type: "string", maxLength: 500 },
      files_modified: { type: "string", description: "Semicolon-separated paths" },
      tests_passed:   { type: "string", enum: ["true", "false", "n/a"] },
      error:          { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["id", "result_status", "findings"]
  }
})
```

4. Merge results into master `tasks.csv`: map `result_status` from `wave-{N}-results.csv` to the `status` column in master CSV; copy `findings`, `files_modified`, `tests_passed`, `error`. Delete `wave-{N}.csv` AND `wave-{N}-results.csv` after merge.

#### Executor Worker Contract (EXECUTOR_INSTRUCTION)

The literal `instruction` string passed to `spawn_agents_on_csv` MUST include the following contract (substitute `{sessionFolder}`, `{phaseDir}`, `{autoCommit}`, `{specsContent}` at build time):

```
You are a task executor. ONE task row is assigned to you.

INPUT (from your CSV row):
  - id, title, description, prev_context (findings from upstream tasks)
  - meta.tdd_phase (red|green|refactor) if TDD mode is enabled

REQUIRED STEPS:
  1. Read prev_context — depend on upstream findings, not memory
  2. Read shared discoveries: {sessionFolder}/discoveries.ndjson
  3. Implement the task: edit/create files per description
  4. Run verification — relevant tests; if TDD, honor tdd_phase semantics
  5. If autoCommit and task succeeded → commit changes with task ID in message
  6. Append discoveries (type=implementation_note / pattern) to discoveries.ndjson
  7. Call report_agent_job_result EXACTLY ONCE

TERMINATION CONTRACT (mandatory — NO worker may end without calling report_agent_job_result):
  - Success path → all files written, tests pass → result_status=completed, tests_passed="true"
  - Blocked path → cannot proceed (missing dep, unclear requirement, contract violation) → result_status=blocked with error explaining what is needed
  - Failure path → unrecoverable error (build error, file write fail) → result_status=failed with error message
  - Timeout path → approaching max_runtime_seconds → revert partial work, report blocked with error="timeout"
  - NEVER continue indefinitely. NEVER exit silently. NEVER omit the call.

OUTPUT (return via report_agent_job_result; must match output_schema):
  {
    "id": "<your row id>",
    "result_status": "completed" | "failed" | "blocked",
    "findings": "<one-sentence summary, max 500 chars>",
    "files_modified": "<semicolon-separated paths or empty>",
    "tests_passed": "true" | "false" | "n/a",
    "error": "<message if not completed, else empty>"
  }

CONSTRAINTS:
  - Modify ONLY files implicated by the task description and prev_context.
  - Do NOT write to tasks.csv, wave-*.csv, results.csv, plan.json, or state.json — orchestrator owns those.
  - Do NOT call spawn_agents_on_csv (no recursion).
  - Honor specs loaded by orchestrator (passed via instruction context).
```

#### Blocked Task Handling

After each wave: if blocked tasks exist, prompt user to continue or stop (AUTO_YES: auto-continue). Skip tasks whose deps are blocked/failed.

#### Cascading Skip

Blocked/failed tasks cascade: mark all downstream dependents as `skipped` with error "Dependency {dep_id} blocked/failed".

### Phase 3: Results Aggregation

**Objective**: Update all state files and generate execution report.

1. Export final `tasks.csv` as `results.csv`

2. **Update task files**: Write each task's status from CSV back to `.task/{id}.json`

3. **Issue status sync**: For tasks with `issue_id`, update `.workflow/issues/issues.jsonl`:
   - All task_refs completed -> `issue.status = "resolved"`; any failed -> `"in_progress"`
   - Append history entry: `{ action: "executed", at: <ISO>, by: "maestro-execute", summary: "TASK-{NNN} {status}" }`

4. **Register EXC artifact in state.json**: Find matching plan artifact, create `{ id: "EXC-{next_id}", type: "execute", milestone, phase, scope, path, status: "completed", depends_on: plan_artifact.id, harvested: false, created_at, completed_at }`. `milestone` MUST come from D-007 `phase_slugs` reverse lookup (numeric phase) — inherit from matching plan artifact if available, otherwise reverse-lookup directly.

5. **Extract incremental specs**: Read `.summaries/`, use `maestro spec add` CLI:
   - Learnings/pitfalls → `maestro spec add learning "<title>" "<content>" --keywords ... --source execute:{PLAN_DIR}`
   - Design rationale → `maestro spec add coding "<title>" "<content>" --keywords ...`
   - Root cause/workaround → `maestro spec add debug "<title>" "<content>" --keywords ...`
   Mark artifact `harvested: true`

6. **Post-task Knowledge Inquiry**: After each task completes, evaluate inquiry triggers:

   - **Execution deviation**: If task summary mentions approach change, dependency swap, or plan deviation:
     → Prompt: "TASK-{NNN} deviated from the plan. Record as architecture constraint?"
     → On confirm: `maestro spec add arch "<decision>" "<rationale>" --keywords ... --source execute:{PLAN_DIR}`

   - **Retry success**: If task required >=2 retries before completion:
     → Prompt: "TASK-{NNN} succeeded after {N} retries. Document this fix pattern?"
     → On confirm: `maestro spec add debug "<pattern>" "<content>" --keywords ... --source execute:{PLAN_DIR}`

   - **Implicit knowledge**: If task summary contains design rationale ("chose X because", "rejected Y due to"):
     → Prompt: "Design decision detected. Record as a learning?"
     → On confirm: `maestro spec add learning "<decision>" "<rationale>" --keywords ... --source execute:{PLAN_DIR}`

   Use `request_user_input` for prompts:
   ```json
   { "questions": [{ "id": "knowledge-capture", "header": "Knowledge Capture", "question": "...", "options": [{ "label": "Yes", "description": "Record to specs" }, { "label": "Skip", "description": "Continue without recording" }] }] }
   ```

7. **Generate context.md**: Execution report with summary (tasks/blocked/waves/auto-commit), per-wave result table (task, status, files, tests), blocked tasks, discovery board summary, next steps.

8. **Auto-sync** (if config.json.codebase.auto_sync_after_execute == true): detect changed files, trigger codebase doc update.

9. **Display completion report**: Phase, completed/blocked counts, wave progress, paths to `.summaries/` and `.task/`, next step suggestions (`maestro-verify`, `manage-status`).

### Shared Discovery Board Protocol

#### Standard Discovery Types

| Type | Dedup Key | Data Schema | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `code_pattern` | `data.name` | `{name, file, description}` | Reusable code pattern found during implementation |
| `integration_point` | `data.file` | `{file, description, exports[]}` | Module connection point discovered |
| `convention` | singleton | `{naming, imports, formatting}` | Project coding conventions observed |
| `blocker` | `data.issue` | `{issue, severity, impact}` | Blocking issue encountered |
| `tech_stack` | singleton | `{framework, language, tools[]}` | Technology stack detail confirmed |
| `test_command` | `data.command` | `{command, scope, result}` | Working test command discovered |

#### Protocol

Read `discoveries.ndjson` before implementation. Append-only: dedup by type+key before writing, never modify/delete.

```bash
echo '{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"TASK-001","type":"code_pattern","data":{"name":"Result type","file":"src/types/result.ts","description":"All functions return Result<T,E> for error handling"}}' >> {session_folder}/discoveries.ndjson
```
</execution>

| No pending tasks (all completed) | Abort with info: "All tasks already completed" |
| Task file (.task/TASK-*.json) missing | Skip task, log error, mark as failed |
