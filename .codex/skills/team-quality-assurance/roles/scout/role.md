# Multi-Perspective Scout

## Phase 2: Context & Scope Assessment

| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Task description | From task subject/description | Yes |
| Session path | Extracted from task description | Yes |
| .msg/meta.json | {run_dir}/work/team/wisdom/.msg/meta.json | No |

1. Extract session path and target scope from task description
2. Determine scan scope: explicit scope from task or `**/*` default
3. Get recent changed files: `git diff --name-only HEAD~5 2>/dev/null || echo ""`
4. Read .msg/meta.json for historical defect patterns (`defect_patterns`)
5. Select scan perspectives based on task description:
   - Default: `["bug", "security", "test-coverage", "code-quality"]`
   - Add `"ux"` if task mentions UX/UI
6. Assess complexity to determine scan strategy:

| Complexity | Condition | Strategy |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Low | < 5 changed files, no specific keywords | ACE search + Grep inline |
| Medium | 5-15 files or specific perspective requested | CLI fan-out (3 core perspectives) |
| High | > 15 files or full-project scan | CLI fan-out (all perspectives) |

## Phase 3: Multi-Perspective Scan

**Low complexity**: Use `` for quick pattern-based scan.

**Medium/High complexity**: Multi-prompt `maestro explore` (preferred for read-only scan):

Build one prompt per active perspective:
```bash
maestro explore \
  "FIND: <perspective1> issues and anti-patterns
SCOPE: <scan-scope>
ATTENTION: common <perspective1> problems
EXPECTED: severity + file:line + description" \
  "FIND: <perspective2> issues and anti-patterns
SCOPE: <scan-scope>
EXPECTED: severity + file:line + description" \
  --max-turns 3 --json
```

**Fallback** (when deeper analysis needed per perspective): `maestro delegate "<prompt>" --role analyze --mode analysis`

After all perspectives complete:
- Parse CLI outputs into structured findings
- Deduplicate by file:line (merge perspectives for same location)
- Compare against known defect patterns from .msg/meta.json
- Rank by severity: critical > high > medium > low

### Tech Profile Scan

After scanning, emit context-aware trigger signals (based on detected codebase characteristics):

1. Check scan findings → signals (`sql_detected`, `auth_detected`, `injection_risk`, `eval_usage`)
2. Check quality issues → risk signals (`test_gap`, `legacy_patterns`, `perf_sensitive`)
3. Include `tech_profile` in Phase 5 state_update data

## Phase 4: Result Aggregation

1. Build `discoveredIssues` array from critical + high findings (with id, severity, perspective, file, line, description)
2. Write scan results to `{run_dir}/outputs/scan/scan-results.json`:
   - scan_date, perspectives scanned, total findings, by_severity counts, findings detail, issues_created count
3. Update `{run_dir}/work/team/wisdom/.msg/meta.json`: merge `discovered_issues` field
4. Contribute to wisdom/issues.md if new patterns found
