<purpose>
Wave-based multi-role brainstorming via `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Diamond topology:
Wave 1 (guidance spec) → Wave 2 (parallel role analysis, 3-9 agents) → Wave 3 (synthesis + feature index).
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — topic text and optional flags.

**Flags**: `-y` (auto), `-c N` (concurrency, default 6), `--continue` (resume), `--count N` (roles, default 3 max 9), `--skip-questions`

**9 valid roles**: data-architect, product-manager, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, system-architect, test-strategist, ui-designer, ux-expert

### Pre-load specs
1. **Architecture specs**: `maestro spec load --category arch` — load architecture constraints as context for multi-role analysis (roles respect documented decisions).
2. **Role Knowledge**: `maestro wiki list --category arch` → identify relevant entries → `maestro wiki load <id1> [id2...]`
3. Both optional — proceed without if unavailable.

**Session**: `.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-brainstorm-{slug}/`
**Output**: tasks.csv, results.csv, discoveries.ndjson, context.md, `.brainstorming/` (guidance-specification.md, feature-index.json, synthesis-changelog.md, feature-specs/, {role}/analysis*.md)
</context>

<csv_schema>
```csv

```
Wave 1: 1 guidance row. Wave 2: N role rows (parallel). Wave 3: 1 synthesis row.
</csv_schema>

<invariants>
1. **Wave order sacred**: Guidance (W1) MUST complete before roles (W2)
2. **CSV source of truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
3. **Discovery board append-only**: Never modify/delete discoveries.ndjson
4. **Skip on failure**: Guidance fails → abort. All roles fail → skip synthesis.
5. **9 valid roles only**: data-architect, product-manager, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, system-architect, test-strategist, ui-designer, ux-expert
6. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous until all waves complete; only pause at [CHECKPOINT] (skipped with -y)

### Wave agent responsibilities

**Guidance (W1)**: Analyze topic → extract 5-10 terms → define non-goals → decompose features (max 8, F-{3digit}) → RFC 2119 keywords → write guidance-specification.md

**Role (W2)**: Read guidance-spec → analyze through role lens → feature-point organization (analysis.md index + analysis-cross-cutting.md + per-feature analysis-F-{id}.md) or fallback single analysis.md. system-architect MUST include: Data Model, State Machine, Error Handling, Observability, Config Model.

**Synthesis (W3)**: Cross-role consensus/conflicts/unique → conflict tags [RESOLVED]/[SUGGESTED]/[UNRESOLVED] → feature-specs or synthesis-specification.md → feature-index.json + synthesis-changelog.md. Four-layer: Direct Reference → Structured Extraction → Conflict Distillation → Cross-Feature Annotation.

### A_DESIGN_EXPLORE

When ui-designer is among selected roles, establish visual direction before Wave 2:

1. If `.workflow/impeccable/PRODUCT.md` missing → run `$maestro-impeccable teach`
2. If `.workflow/impeccable/DESIGN.md` missing → run `$maestro-impeccable explore`
3. If both already exist → skip (visual direction already locked)

explore generates multi-style HTML prototypes, visual comparison, user selection/mix, and produces DESIGN.md.
ui-designer agents in Wave 2 then focus on UX analysis only (interaction flows, state design), not visual styling.

### A_AGGREGATE

1. Export results.csv
2. Generate context.md (summary, guidance, per-role findings, synthesis, feature index, next steps)
3. Confidence scoring: 5 dimensions (role_coverage, cross_role_consistency, feature_completeness, spec_quality, design_feasibility). Quality gate: >3 UNRESOLVED → warn.
4. Copy artifacts to target .brainstorming/
5. Next-step routing: DESIGN.md established → `maestro-impeccable build <feature>`; else UI features detected → `maestro-impeccable build <feature>`; else → maestro-analyze / maestro-plan / maestro-roadmap
