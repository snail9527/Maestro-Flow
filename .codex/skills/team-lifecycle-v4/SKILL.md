<purpose>
Wave-based lifecycle orchestration via `spawn_agents_on_csv`. Fixed roles with pre-defined pipelines: specification → planning → implementation → testing → review.

**Core workflow**: Select Pipeline → Build CSV from Pipeline Definition → Wave-by-Wave Execution → Aggregate Results

### Session Structure

```
.workflow/.csv-wave/{YYYYMMDD}-tlv4-{slug}/
+-- tasks.csv              (master state)

### tasks.csv (Master State)

```csv
id,title,description,role,pipeline_phase,deps,context_from,wave
"RESEARCH-001","Domain research","PURPOSE: Research domain, competitors, constraints | Success: Discovery context packaged\nTASK:\n  - Analyze problem space\n  - Explore codebase patterns\n  - Package context\nEXPECTED: spec/discovery-context.json\nCONSTRAINTS: Read-only","analyst","research","","","1"

```

**Input columns** (present in initial tasks.csv and wave-N.csv):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Task ID: `{PREFIX}-{NNN}` |
| `title` | Short task title |
| `description` | Task instructions (PURPOSE/TASK/EXPECTED/CONSTRAINTS) |
| `role` | Fixed role name from registry |
| `pipeline_phase` | Phase identifier (research, product-brief, requirements, etc.) |
| `deps` | Semicolon-separated dependency task IDs |
| `context_from` | Semicolon-separated task IDs for context |
| `wave` | Wave number |

**Lifecycle columns** (initialized with defaults, updated during execution):

| Column | Initial Value | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `status` | `pending` | Task lifecycle: pending → completed/failed/blocked/skipped |
| `findings` | `""` | Populated from output_schema merge |
| `files_modified` | `""` | Populated from output_schema merge |
| `quality_score` | `""` | Populated from output_schema merge |
| `error` | `""` | Populated from output_schema merge |

**Dynamic column** (added to wave-N.csv only, not in initial tasks.csv):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `prev_context` | Concatenated findings from context_from tasks, format: `--- TASK-ID: {id} ---\n{findings}` |

**Output columns** (via `output_schema` only, NOT in any CSV input):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `result_status` | completed / failed / blocked (maps to master `status`) |
| `findings` | Key findings (max 500 chars) |
| `files_modified` | Semicolon-separated paths |
| `quality_score` | Numeric quality score (0-100) |
| `error` | Error message if failed |

**Column separation rule**: Input/lifecycle columns and output_schema MUST NOT share names. `result_status` → master `status` during merge.

<invariants>
1. **Start Immediately**: First action is session initialization
2. **Wave Order is Sacred**: Execute waves sequentially
3. **CSV is Source of Truth**: Master tasks.csv holds all state
4. **Column Separation Rule**: Input and output_schema columns MUST NOT share names
5. **Context Propagation**: prev_context from master CSV findings
6. **Discovery Board is Append-Only**: Never clear/modify discoveries.ndjson
7. **Cascading Skip on Failure**: Failed tasks cascade to dependents
8. **Cleanup Temp Files**: Delete wave-N.csv and wave-N-results.csv after merge
9. **Checkpoint Pause**: After CHECKPOINT waves, pause for user approval (skip if -y)
10. **DO NOT STOP**: Continuous execution between checkpoints
11. **Role Files are Authoritative**: Agents read roles/{role}/role.md for domain logic

<actions>

### Session Initialization (S_PARSE)

```
Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
  AUTO_YES        ← --yes | -y
  continueMode    ← --continue
  maxConcurrency  ← --concurrency | -c N  (default: 3)
  pipelineFlag    ← --pipeline spec-only|impl-only|full-lifecycle
  noSupervision   ← --no-supervision (skip CHECKPOINT tasks)
  taskDescription ← remaining text

Derive:
  dateStr        ← UTC+8 YYYYMMDD
  slug           ← first 3 meaningful words, kebab-case
  sessionId      ← "{dateStr}-tlv4-{slug}"
  sessionFolder  ← ".workflow/.csv-wave/{sessionId}"
  skillRoot      ← resolve path to this skill directory

mkdir -p {sessionFolder}/{spec,plan,artifacts}
```

### Pipeline Selection (S_PIPELINE)

1. If `--pipeline` flag → use specified pipeline
2. Else scan task description keywords against [specs/pipelines.md](specs/pipelines.md) §1:
   - spec/design/document/requirements → `spec-only`
   - implement/build/fix/code → `impl-only`
   - full/lifecycle/end-to-end → `full-lifecycle`
   - Ambiguous → `request_user_input`
3. Validate pipeline selection

### CSV Generation (S_CSV_GEN)

1. Load pipeline definition from [specs/pipelines.md](specs/pipelines.md)
2. **Supervision opt-out**: if `--no-supervision`, filter out all CHECKPOINT-* tasks from pipeline. Adjust deps: tasks that depended on CHECKPOINT tasks now depend on the CHECKPOINT's upstream instead.
3. For each task in pipeline, build CSV row:
   - `id`: from task registry (RESEARCH-001, DRAFT-001, etc.)
   - `description`: PURPOSE/TASK/EXPECTED/CONSTRAINTS with session-specific context
   - `role`: from registry
   - `pipeline_phase`: from registry
   - `deps`: from pipeline dependency chain
   - `context_from`: same as deps (upstream findings needed)
   - `wave`: from pipeline wave assignment table (recalculate if checkpoints removed)
4. Initialize lifecycle columns: `status=pending`, empty `findings`/`files_modified`/`quality_score`/`error`
5. Write `tasks.csv`
6. Write empty `discoveries.ndjson`
7. User validation (skip if `-y`): display pipeline, task count, wave structure

### Wave Execution Engine (S_WAVE_{N})

For each wave N:

#### Step 1: Skip check
- If all tasks in wave N are already completed/skipped → skip to next wave
- If any dep is failed/blocked → cascade skip

#### Step 2: Build prev_context
For each task in wave N:
- Read `context_from` task IDs → extract their `findings` from master CSV
- Concatenate as `prev_context`

#### Step 3: Write wave-{N}.csv
Extract wave N rows + add `prev_context` column.

#### Step 4: Execute

```javascript
spawn_agents_on_csv({
  csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-${N}.csv`,
  id_column: "id",
  instruction: buildLifecycleInstruction(sessionFolder, skillRoot),
  max_concurrency: maxConcurrency,
  max_runtime_seconds: 3600,
  output_csv_path: `${sessionFolder}/wave-${N}-results.csv`,
  output_schema: {
    id,
    result_status,    // completed | failed | blocked
    findings,         // key findings (max 500 chars)
    files_modified,   // semicolon-separated paths
    quality_score,    // 0-100
    error             // error message
  }
})
```

#### Step 5: Merge + Cleanup
1. Map `result_status` → master `status`
2. Copy `findings`, `files_modified`, `quality_score`, `error`
3. Delete `wave-{N}.csv` AND `wave-{N}-results.csv`
4. Cascade skip failed task dependents

#### Step 6: Checkpoint handling
If wave N was a CHECKPOINT task:
- Read supervisor's `findings` and `quality_score`
- If quality_score >= 80 (pass) → continue
- If 60-79 (review) → display warnings, continue (or pause if not -y)
- If < 60 (fail) → pause for user: Revise / Override / Abort

### Instruction Builder

```
You are a team-lifecycle-v4 agent executing a software development task.

## Your Identity
- Role: read from your CSV row 'role' column
- Task: read from your CSV row 'description' column (PURPOSE/TASK/EXPECTED/CONSTRAINTS)
- Phase: read from your CSV row 'pipeline_phase' column

## Role Definition
Read your detailed role instructions from:
  {skillRoot}/roles/{role}/role.md

Follow the execution protocol defined in your role.md (Phase 2-4 structure).

For roles with commands/ subdirectory, load the relevant command file based on your task type.

## Context
- Session: {sessionFolder}
- Discovery board: {sessionFolder}/discoveries.ndjson (read before work, append findings)
- Previous context: read your CSV row 'prev_context' column
- Templates: {skillRoot}/templates/ (for writer role)
- Quality gates: {skillRoot}/specs/quality-gates.md

## Quality Contract
1. Verify all outputs exist before reporting completed
2. Include quality_score (0-100) based on specs/quality-gates.md criteria
3. Retry on verification failure (max 2 retries)
4. Report blocked if still failing after retries

## Discovery Protocol
Write task output to {sessionFolder}/discoveries/{task_id}.json:
{
  "task_id": "<id>", "role": "<role>", "status": "<result_status>",
  "findings": "<summary>", "quality_score": <N>,
  "artifacts_produced": ["<paths>"], "files_modified": ["<paths>"]
}

Append to {sessionFolder}/discoveries.ndjson:
{"ts":"<ISO>","worker":"<id>","type":"<pipeline_phase>","data":{...}}

## Output
Return via output_schema:
- result_status: completed | failed | blocked
- findings: key findings (max 500 chars)
- files_modified: semicolon-separated paths
- quality_score: 0-100 per quality-gates.md
- error: error message if not completed
```

### Results Aggregation (S_AGGREGATE)

1. Export `results.csv`
2. Generate `context.md`:
   - Pipeline type, task count, completed/failed/skipped
   - Per-wave results with quality scores
   - Checkpoint verdicts
   - Files modified
   - Discovery summary
   - Next steps (if spec-only: suggest impl-only; if impl: suggest deploy)
3. Display completion report
