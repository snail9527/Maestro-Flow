# Workflow: Odyssey Improve

6-dimension runtime quality improvement — performance/security/architecture/reliability/observability/maintainability audit → diagnose → fix → generalize.

---

## State Chain

```
S_INTAKE → S_SURVEY → S_AUDIT → S_DIAGNOSE → S_FIX → S_VERIFY → [back-half]
```

Back-half: `S_GENERALIZE → S_DISCOVER → S_RECORD → END` (see odyssey-base.md §Shared Back-Half).

---

## Boundary

**In scope:** Runtime quality improvement — performance/security/architecture/reliability/observability/maintainability audit → diagnose → fix → generalize. **Out of scope:** UI visual → `--mode ui` | New features → `--mode planex` | Single bug → `--mode debug` | Style review → `--mode review`. Zero-residual applies.

---

## Context

### Target Resolution

| Input | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Module/dir path | Audit that module |
| `HEAD` / `staged` | Review changes in diff |
| Feature area keyword | Resolve to related files |
| `--all` | Full project scan (use with caution) |

### Dimensions (6)

1. **performance** — hot paths, N+1, memory allocation, cache efficiency, bundle size, lazy loading
2. **security** — OWASP Top 10, injection, auth bypass, data exposure, dependency vulns, secrets
3. **architecture** — layer violations, circular deps, coupling, interface contracts, SRP
4. **reliability** — error handling gaps, retry, timeout, graceful degradation, resource cleanup
5. **observability** — logging coverage, metric gaps, trace propagation, error reporting, health checks
6. **maintainability** — cyclomatic complexity, dead code, test coverage gaps, doc debt

### Session Fields

```json
{ "target": "", "dimensions": [], "baseline_metrics": {},
  "audit_result": {}, "diagnoses": [], "confirmation": null,
  "generalization_stats": null }
```

### evidence.ndjson Phases

### Transitions

```
S_SURVEY   → S_AUDIT       : complete
S_AUDIT → S_DIAGNOSE       : critical/high findings exist
S_AUDIT → S_GENERALIZE     : no critical/high, !skip_generalize
S_AUDIT → S_RECORD         : no findings OR skip_generalize
S_DIAGNOSE → S_FIX         : root causes identified, !skip_fix
S_DIAGNOSE → S_GENERALIZE  : root causes identified, skip_fix, !skip_generalize
S_DIAGNOSE → S_RECORD      : root causes identified, skip_fix, skip_generalize
S_DIAGNOSE → S_DIAGNOSE    : hypotheses failed, retries < 3 → A_ESCALATE_DIAGNOSIS
S_DIAGNOSE → S_RECORD      : retries >= 3 → INCONCLUSIVE
S_FIX      → S_VERIFY      : fix implemented
S_VERIFY → S_GENERALIZE    : verified, !skip_generalize
S_VERIFY → S_RECORD        : verified, skip_generalize
S_VERIFY → S_FIX           : needs_rework
```

### Actions

**A_INTAKE extra** — Baseline capture: record current metrics (test pass rate, bundle size, dependency count, complexity hotspots) to `session.json.baseline_metrics`.

**A_SURVEY** — (1) Dependency audit (package.json/lock), complexity scan (size/nesting), test coverage map, error handling scan (empty catch, unhandled promise). (2) CLI-assisted (optional): `maestro delegate --role analyze --mode analysis` for dependency health / complexity hotspots / coverage gaps / error patterns (`run_in_background: true`). (3) Evidence phase=survey. Update §2. Mark G1.

Commit: `"odyssey-improve({slug}): SURVEY — current state survey complete"`

**A_AUDIT** — Spawn 6 parallel Agents (one per dimension, or `--dimensions` subset). Each returns `[{title, severity, dimension, file, line, description, suggestion, measurement}]`. Merge → evidence phase=audit. Write `session.json.audit_result`. Update §3 (findings by dimension + severity matrix). Mark G2.

**GATE: all-dimensions-audited** — all 6 dimensions (or `--dimensions` subset) completed with structured findings, merged into severity matrix, evidence phase=audit logged per dimension. Zero dimensions reviewed is BLOCKED (W002 partial from agent failure is a warning).

Commit: `"odyssey-improve({slug}): AUDIT — dimension audit complete"`

**A_DIAGNOSE** — Root cause analysis for critical/high findings — don't fix symptoms. (1) Group by dimension, prioritize by severity; for each: hypothesis → trace code path + git history → evidence phase=diagnosis. (2) Ambiguity → evidence phase=decision; Normal: [@ask] AskUserQuestion | `-y`: defer. (3) CLI-assisted for complex findings (`run_in_background: true`). (4) Write `session.json.diagnoses[]`. Update §4. Mark G3.

Commit: `"odyssey-improve({slug}): DIAGNOSE — root cause analysis complete"`

**A_ESCALATE_DIAGNOSIS** — `retries++`. < 3: `maestro delegate --role analyze`, new hypotheses, → S_DIAGNOSE. >= 3: Normal → [@ask] AskUserQuestion | `-y` → INCONCLUSIVE → S_RECORD.

**A_FIX** — (1) Exhaustive fix: ALL diagnosed issues by severity tier (critical → high → medium → low within fix_threshold), one dimension at a time. After each tier, re-verify **current tier's dimension only** (not all dimensions); new findings at same or higher severity append to current tier. Cross-dimension regression checks run once at S_VERIFY after all tiers. **No partial-tier advancement** — each tier fully addressed (fixed or individually classified) before advancing; blanket "pre-existing" skip forbidden. (2) For each fix: implement → evidence phase=fix. (3) Normal: [@ask] AskUserQuestion per-fix | `-y`: auto-proceed, record `deferred`.

Commit: `"odyssey-improve({slug}): FIX — {dimension} {tier} tier addressed"`

**A_VERIFY** — (1) Run tests covering modified areas. (2) Re-capture metrics, compare with `baseline_metrics`. (3) CLI-assisted: `maestro delegate --role review --mode analysis` (`run_in_background: true`). (4) `needs_rework` → S_FIX; `verified` → mark G4. (5) Write `confirmation`. Update §5 (before/after metrics table).

**GATE: zero-remaining-verified** — every diagnosed finding is fixed and verified, individually classified (issue / decision), or skipped via `--skip-fix`; tests pass over modified areas; metrics re-captured and compared against `baseline_metrics`; no unaddressed actionable findings; before/after table written to understanding.md §8.

Commit: `"odyssey-improve({slug}): VERIFY — fix verification complete"`

---

## Generalize Source

Diagnosed root causes + applied fixes across all dimensions. **Discover routing:** `bug` → S_FIX; new critical → S_DIAGNOSE.

---

## Knowledge Persistence (§9)

A_RECORD extra: §8 improvement metrics — re-capture and build before/after comparison table from `baseline_metrics` vs current.

## Mode `-y` Points

| Decision Point | Normal | `-y` |
|---------------|--------|------|
| A_FIX confirmation | [@ask] AskUserQuestion | auto-proceed `deferred` |
| A_DIAGNOSE ambiguity | [@ask] AskUserQuestion | best-effort `deferred` |
| A_ESCALATE 3-strike | [@ask] AskUserQuestion | auto INCONCLUSIVE |
| A_DISCOVER routing | [@ask] AskUserQuestion | auto create issue |
| Ambiguous items | [@ask] AskUserQuestion | all `deferred` |

---

## Phase Gates

- **Discovery gate** (SURVEY): evidence for the phase logged, understanding.md updated. Survey requires all scan types attempted.
- **Audit gate** (DIAGNOSE): all dimension agents completed, findings merged with severity classification. Zero dimensions reviewed is BLOCKED (W002 partial allowed).
- **FIX gate:** current severity tier fully addressed. Per-fix evidence phase=fix logged. Auto-commit per tier. No partial-tier advancement.
- **VERIFY gate:** tests pass; metrics re-captured; confirmation written, understanding.md updated, verify goal marked. needs_rework → route back to FIX.
