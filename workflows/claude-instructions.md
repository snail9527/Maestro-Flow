# Coding Philosophy

## Core Beliefs

- **Pursue good taste** - Eliminate edge cases to make code logic natural and elegant
- **Embrace extreme simplicity** - Complexity is the root of all evil
- **Be pragmatic** - Code must solve real-world problems, not hypothetical ones
- **Data structures first** - Bad programmers worry about code; good programmers worry about data structures
- **Never break backward compatibility** - Existing functionality is sacred and inviolable
- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious
- **Follow existing code style** - Match import patterns, naming conventions, and formatting of existing codebase
- **Minimize changes** - Only modify what's directly required; avoid refactoring, adding features, or "improving" code beyond the request
- **No unsolicited documentation** - NEVER generate reports, documentation files, or summaries without explicit user request. When the active command requires a report, write it only to the current Run's `report.md` or declared typed output.

## Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

## Fix, Don't Hide

**Solve problems, don't silence symptoms** - Skipped tests, `@ts-ignore`, empty catch, `as any`, excessive timeouts = hiding bugs, not fixing them

**NEVER**:
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code
- Generate reports, summaries, or documentation files without explicit user request
- Use suppression mechanisms (`skip`, `ignore`, `disable`) without fixing root cause

**ALWAYS**:
- Plan complex tasks thoroughly before implementation
- Generate task decomposition for multi-module work (>3 modules or >5 subtasks)
- Track progress using TODO checklists for complex tasks
- Validate planning documents before starting development
- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documentation and progress tracking as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess
- **Edit fallback**: When Edit tool fails 2+ times on same file, try Bash sed/awk first, then Write to recreate if still failing

## Learning the Codebase

- Find 3 similar features/components
- Identify common patterns and conventions
- Use same libraries/utilities when possible
- Follow existing test patterns

## Tooling

- Use project's existing build system
- Use project's test framework
- Use project's formatter/linter settings
- Don't introduce new tools without strong justification

## Content Uniqueness Rules

- **Each layer owns its abstraction level** - no content sharing between layers
- **Reference, don't duplicate** - point to other layers, never copy content
- **Maintain perspective** - each layer sees the system at its appropriate scale
- **Avoid implementation creep** - higher layers stay architectural

# Context Requirements

Before implementation, always:
- Identify 3+ existing similar patterns
- Map dependencies and integration points
- Understand testing framework and coding conventions


## Delegate & CLI

- **Delegate Usage**: @~/.maestro/workflows/delegate-usage.md
- **CLI Endpoints Config**: @~/.maestro/cli-tools.json

**Strictly follow the cli-tools.json configuration**

## Explore

Route code search by the Query Rules table (Knowledge System below) — it is the single source for tool selection. Use `maestro explore` only when the entry point is uncertain or a cross-file relationship needs evidence-backed synthesis. For exact text, regex, known files, or exhaustive call-site scans, use `rg`/Grep directly. When using `maestro explore`, call it and stop to wait for results.

```bash
maestro explore "FIND: <target + condition>\nSCOPE: <paths>" [more prompts...] [options]
```

Lightweight read-only codebase search. 1 prompt = 1 agent. Not for write-mode/long sessions — use `delegate`.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-e, --endpoint <names>` | Endpoint name(s), comma-separated |
| `--all` | Fan out each prompt to all endpoints |
| `--json` | Output results as JSON |

Long-tail options (`--max-turns`, `-f`, `--cd`) — see `maestro explore --help`.

### Context Injection

Explore agents have no project awareness — inject context before calling:

| Injection | Field | Content |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Structure | SCOPE | Concrete paths of relevant directories (no wildcard sweeps) |
| Domain | SCOPE | Key file paths already returned by `maestro search` |
| Constraints | ATTENTION | Framework, language, naming conventions |

```
FIND: authentication middleware that validates JWT tokens
SCOPE: src/middleware/, src/auth/, src/api/routes/
ATTENTION: Express.js, middleware files named *.middleware.ts
```

### Prompt Structure

**FIND + SCOPE is the minimum bar.** One declarative sentence per field; no nested conditions.

| Field | Required | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| `FIND` | **Yes** | Decidable concrete target (what + acceptance condition) |
| `SCOPE` | **Yes** | Explicit paths or globs; `**/*` sweeps forbidden |
| `EXCLUDE` | No | File types or directories to skip |
| `ATTENTION` | No | Framework, naming conventions, known pitfalls |
| `EXPECTED` | Recommended | Output format: `file:line` list / summary / JSON |

```
FIND: Functions that call db.query() with string concatenation instead of $1/$2
SCOPE: src/db/**/*.ts, src/api/**/*.ts
EXCLUDE: **/*.test.ts
EXPECTED: file:line list with the SQL string
```

### Cross-Search

For important searches, run 2-3 prompts from different angles concurrently; Claude cross-validates results.

**Split by angle, not by keyword:**

| Angle | Prompt A | Prompt B |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Definition vs call sites | Find function definitions | Find call sites |
| Positive vs negative | Find correct usage | Find missed usage |
| Entry vs implementation | Find exports/routes | Find internal logic |
| By file type | Usage in .ts | Usage in .vue |

**Result confidence:**
- Both hit → high confidence, use directly
- Single hit → verify with Grep/Read
- Zero hits → retry from a different angle or target doesn't exist

### Execution

Multi-prompt — background; single lookup — foreground:

```
Bash({ command: "maestro explore \"p1\" \"p2\" --json", run_in_background: true })
Bash({ command: "maestro explore \"FIND: ...\nSCOPE: ...\"" })
```

Session: `maestro explore show` / `maestro explore output <id>`

## Knowledge System

**Knowledge Gate (required)**: Resolve project knowledge before reading, analyzing, planning against, or modifying project files.

| Context | Required opening |
|---------|------------------|
| Standalone task | First project-related tool call: `maestro search "<1-3 task-specific keywords>" [--type <type>] --json` |
| Fresh orchestrated Run | Inspect the injected birth packet and `knowledge_context`, then make the task-specific search the first project-related tool call |
| Reattached/compacted Run | `maestro run brief <run-id>` may run first; inspect `knowledge_context`, then search/load before project-file access |

This applies to process/ops, code changes, debugging, architecture, review, planning, and config/skill work. `git status`, file-name search, Grep/Read, and `rg '*knowhow*'` do not satisfy the Gate.

When the user says "参考", "参照", `knowhow`, `spec`, or "reference the process", derive the query from the task subject and operation, add the named `--type`, and explicitly load every governing hit before file exploration. Search results, automatic injection, and `knowledge_context` are exposure only; explicit `maestro load` records consumption. `knowledge_context.run.knowledge_ids` lists consumed IDs, not full content: do not repeat load when the full entry is already in context, but reload when reattachment preserved only an ID or summary.

Empty results permit normal discovery only after inspection. If search returns an initialization or recovery hint, execute it and retry first.

**Re-search triggers** (re-query mid-task with new keywords, never repeat old queries): entering a new module/subsystem boundary; same fix failed twice; before architecture/approach decisions.

```bash
maestro search "<query>" [--type <type>] [--category <cat>] [--tag <tag>] [--keyword <word>] [--code] [--kg]
maestro load --type <type> [--list] [--category <cat>] [--keyword <word>] [--tag <tag>] [--id <id>]
```

**--type**: `spec`, `knowhow`, `domain`, `issue`, `session`, `scratch`, `note`, `project`, `roadmap`
**--category** (spec only): `coding`, `arch`, `debug`, `test`, `review`, `learning`, `ui`
**--tag**: Filter by exact tag match (e.g. `diagnosis`, `review-findings`, `lessons`), wiki only
**--keyword**: Filter by keyword in title/body (substring match), wiki only

### Query Rules

1-3 core keywords per query — multiple short queries beat one long one.
Separate concepts from symbols. Add `--kg` for full-source.

| Target | Tool |
|--------|------|
| Known symbol → definition/signature | `maestro search "<Symbol>" --code` (file:line, no agent cost) |
| Concept / knowledge / conventions | `maestro search "<keywords>"` |
| Debug symptoms / review lessons (sealed artifacts) | `maestro search "<keywords>" --tag diagnosis` / `--tag lessons` |
| Exact text / regex / known-file search | `rg` / Grep |
| Exhaustive usage sweep with a known symbol or syntax pattern | `rg` / Grep |
| Unknown entry point / cross-file data flow / pattern needing an evidence-backed synthesis | `maestro explore` |

**Association follow-through** — after a hit, walk one hop along relations instead of re-issuing broad queries:

- Hit a chunked entry (id with `-NNN` suffix) → `maestro load --type knowhow --id <parent-entry-id>` for full text
- Trace references (who cites it / what it cites) → `maestro wiki backlinks <id>` / `maestro wiki forward <id>`
- Rule evolution history → `maestro spec history <sid>`

Zero code hits with a hint (e.g. `code index not initialized`) → run the hinted command, then retry — don't abandon code search.

```bash
# ❌ keyword dump
maestro search "topology display frontend DetailedTopologySVG elk"

# ✅ targeted
maestro search "topology layout"
maestro search "DetailedTopologySVG" --code
maestro load --type spec --category coding
```

### Stable Run Knowledge Invariants

Runtime birth packets, `maestro run brief`, completion receipts, and the `maestro run check` finish checklist are authoritative for Run-specific IDs, reconciliation state, and next commands. Static instructions own only these stable rules:

1. Search and automatic injection are exposure; explicit `load` records consumption.
2. Put accepted decisions and locked constraints in `report.md` frontmatter; completion stages them automatically as pending candidates. Only reusable, prescriptive content belongs there — rules future work must follow. NEVER write execution-state narration as decisions/constraints (read-only declarations, worktree or audit-process observations, missing-file notes, routing memos such as "Read-only audit; preserve the existing dirty worktree" or "Debug investigation remained read-only"); seal auto-stages every accepted decision / locked constraint as a corpus candidate, so state narration pollutes the knowledge base.
3. Stage reusable recipes or pitfalls with `maestro knowledge stage spec|knowhow "<title>" --content-file <path|-> --run <run-id> [--category <category>]`; write content to a temp file, never inline. Without a Run, session-source staging works the same way via `--session <session-id> --evidence <file:line,...>` (write authority resolves through identity tiers; with nothing running a daily synthetic knowledge Session is created). **Staging Quality Bar** — stage content only if future work can directly reuse it and at least one holds: (a) a pitfall warning ("when doing X, watch out for Y because Z" — non-obvious failure mode plus prevention); (b) a failure lesson (what failed, root cause, what worked instead); (c) a non-trivial trade-off (why A over B, with the constraints/context); (d) a newly established prescriptive constraint (spec). NEVER stage: process notes ("did X", "produced document Y"); re-descriptions of existing project patterns that code/config already documents; trivial or obvious operations; raw traces (tool outputs, log or error fragments) — distill traces into a lesson first, discard when nothing reusable can be distilled. **Zero candidates is a legitimate outcome** — never manufacture candidates to justify the pipeline.
4. When staging content that cites, validates, or contradicts existing knowledge, add `--signal cited|validated|contradicted --signal-ids <comma-separated ids>` (space-separated values leak into positional arguments).
5. Routine Run completion never writes project Spec/Knowhow directly and never promotes candidates.
6. The finish checklist is soft guidance. Work through it and put intentionally unresolved items in `report.md` concerns. Unresolved reconciliation may be sealed but cannot be promoted.
7. Review, resolve, promote, supersede, conflict marking, and audit are explicit governance actions. Execute them only when the user requests knowledge governance or a confirmed workflow step requires it.

Outside a Run, governed staging remains available (see item 3); direct `/maestro-spec` or `/maestro-knowhow` writes stay reserved for explicit knowledge-management work. Category routing: decisions→`arch`, patterns→`coding`, pitfalls→`debug`/`learning`, rules→`review`, tests→`test`.

### Governance Boundary

Use commands supplied by the current `knowledge_context`, completion receipt, and `run check` output; those Runtime surfaces override static examples here.

- `maestro knowledge review <session-id> --refresh` refreshes reconciliation; inline adjudication + promotion is one `maestro knowledge promote <session-id> --resolve <candidate-id> --as <choice> [--target <knowledge-id>] --reason "<reason>"` call (`review --resolve` remains a compatible fallback).
- Review Presentation Protocol: when candidates need a disposition, the agent runs `review --json` itself, presents each candidate (title, content summary, evidence anchors, evidence-backed matches, recommended disposition + one-line rationale), collects the user's decisions, and only then executes the `promote --resolve` inline adjudication (or the `review --resolve` fallback). The user decides; the agent never hands over the raw review command as the whole task. Under `-y`, only verified clearly-unique candidates may be auto-resolved as `unique`.
- Promotion requires eligible candidates with fresh receipts. Run-source candidates require every source Run sealed. A `session/2.0` session-source candidate does not require Session seal: it requires immutable candidate version/content hash, exact Session activity revision, non-empty evidence roots/hash, and a fresh session reconciliation receipt for the candidate snapshot and current corpus fingerprint, revalidated at final commit. Normal completion and Execution seal never imply approval or promotion.
- Direct-write whitelist: only explicit knowledge-management commands may write the corpus directly (`maestro spec add`, `maestro knowhow add`, `maestro domain add`, and the knowhow/wiki maintenance commands). Content-producing workflows (retrospective, wiki-digest, wiki-connect, maestro-learn, ui-codify-knowhow, harvest, finish-work) MUST route knowledge through `stage → review → promote` — never direct `.workflow/specs/` or `.workflow/knowhow/` writes (the corpus is scanned, injected, and indexed; sid-less direct entries pollute it).
- A pending backlog remains durable and visible; neither Run completion, Execution seal, nor legacy Session seal silently promotes or discards candidates.
- Deprecated/superseded knowledge remains auditable and is excluded from normal search and injection.
- Low exposure never triggers automatic deletion or pruning.
