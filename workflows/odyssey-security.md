# Workflow: Odyssey Security

Read-only tiered security audit — OWASP Top 10 / dependency supply chain / secrets / CI/CD / STRIDE / git history → severity matrix report → generalize security patterns.

---

## State Chain

```
S_INTAKE → S_RECON → S_SCAN → S_REPORT → [back-half]
```

Back-half: `S_GENERALIZE → S_DISCOVER → S_RECORD → END` (see odyssey-base.md §Shared Back-Half).

**No S_FIX / S_CONFIRM** — this mode is read-only. Findings route to `--mode improve` or `--mode debug` for remediation.

---

## Boundary

**In scope:** Read-only security audit — OWASP Top 10, dependency supply chain, secrets detection, CI/CD pipeline, STRIDE threat modeling, git history archaeology → severity matrix report → generalize security patterns.
**Out of scope:** Fixing vulnerabilities → `--mode improve` | Root cause debug → `--mode debug` | Feature implementation → `--mode planex` | UI → `--mode ui`. Read-only invariant applies: NEVER modify source code.

---

## Context

Target resolution (input → audit scope) and tier coverage (which audits each tier runs) are defined in `prepare/odyssey-security.md` §Input Interpretation — that is the canonical wording.

### Session Fields

```json
{ "target": "", "tier": "standard", "scan_phases": [],
  "audit_result": {}, "findings_count": {},
  "generalization_stats": null }
```

### evidence.ndjson Phases

`recon|scan|report|discovery|decision|self-iteration`

- `recon`: `category` (tech_stack|entry_point|auth_module|data_flow), `detail`
- `scan`: `phase` (owasp|dependency|secrets|cicd|stride|git_history), `severity`, `cwe`
- `report`: `finding_ref`, `remediation`

### phase_goals[]

| ID | Goal | Phase | skip_when |
|----|------|-------|-----------|
| G1 | Recon completed | S_RECON | — |
| G2 | Scan completed (all tier phases) | S_SCAN | — |
| G3 | Report produced | S_REPORT | — |
| G4 | Pattern generalized | S_GENERALIZE | skip_generalize |
| G5 | Discoveries triaged | S_DISCOVER | skip_generalize |
| G6 | Learnings persisted | S_RECORD | — |

### understanding.md — 7 Sections

1. Target & Tier
2. Reconnaissance
3. Scan Findings (by phase)
4. Severity Matrix
5. Full Report (findings + remediation)
6. Generalization
7. Discoveries & Learnings

---

## State Machine

### Transitions

```
S_RECON  → S_SCAN        : complete
S_SCAN   → S_REPORT      : all tier phases complete
S_REPORT → S_GENERALIZE  : report produced, !skip_generalize
S_REPORT → S_RECORD      : report produced, skip_generalize
```

Discover routes: new security concern in sibling module → S_SCAN (re-scan with expanded scope, loops < max_loops).

---

## Actions

**A_INTAKE extra** — Tier resolution: parse `--tier` flag (default: standard). Record tier + applicable scan phases to `session.json.scan_phases`.

**A_RECON** — (1) Detect tech stack from package.json / go.mod / requirements.txt / Cargo.toml. (2) Identify entry points: HTTP handlers, API routes, CLI parsers, WebSocket handlers. (3) List authentication/authorization modules. (4) Map data flow: user input → processing → storage → output. (5) Evidence phase=recon. Update §2. Mark G1.

**GATE: recon-complete** — tech stack detected, entry points identified, auth/authz modules listed, data flow mapped. Evidence phase=recon logged. §2 updated. BLOCKED if no entry points found (E002).

Commit: `"odyssey-security({slug}): RECON — reconnaissance complete"`

**A_SCAN** — Tier-gated parallel scan phases:

- **OWASP Top 10** (all tiers): Spawn parallel agents per category (A01-A10). Each scans relevant source files using Grep pattern matching (`eval(`, `exec(`, `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `sql.*\+.*req\.`, `process\.env` without validation). Returns `[{title, severity, category, file, line, description, cwe, remediation}]`.

| # | Category | What to check |
|---|----------|--------------|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | Missing auth middleware, direct object references, path traversal |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures | Weak algorithms, hardcoded keys, missing TLS, plaintext storage |
| A03 | Injection | SQL concatenation, shell exec with user input, template injection |
| A04 | Insecure Design | Missing rate limits, no CSRF tokens, predictable tokens |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | Debug mode, default credentials, verbose errors, open CORS |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components | Known CVEs in dependencies |
| A07 | Auth Failures | Weak password rules, missing brute-force protection, session fixation |
| A08 | Data Integrity | Deserialization of untrusted data, unsigned updates |
| A09 | Logging Failures | Missing audit logs, logging sensitive data |
| A10 | SSRF | Unvalidated URLs in server-side requests |

- **Dependency Audit** (all tiers): `npm audit --json` / lockfile integrity / typosquatting risk on critical dependencies.
- **Secrets Detection** (standard + deep): Grep for `(password|secret|api.?key|token|credential).*=.*['"][^'"]{8,}` in `*.{ts,js,json,env*}`. Check `.env.example` for leaked values. Check `.gitignore` for missing `.env` patterns. **NEVER log actual secret values.**
- **CI/CD Audit** (standard + deep): Scan `.github/workflows/*.yml` for overly permissive permissions, unpinned action versions, secrets in logs, `pull_request_target` injection risk.
- **STRIDE Threat Modeling** (deep only): For each critical module from recon:

| Threat | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **S**poofing | Can identity be faked? Is auth per-request? |
| **T**ampering | Can data be modified in transit/storage? Integrity checks? |
| **R**epudiation | Are actions logged with user identity? |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Can unauthorized data be accessed? |
| **D**enial of Service | Resource limits? Rate limiting? |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Can roles be escalated? Input validation on role fields? |

- **Git History Archaeology** (deep only): Search for previously committed secrets (`git log --all --diff-filter=D -- "*.env" "*.key" "*.pem"`), password strings in history.

Merge all findings → evidence phase=scan. Write `session.json.audit_result`. Update §3 (findings by phase) + §4 (severity matrix). Mark G2.

**GATE: scan-complete** — all tier-required scan phases completed with structured findings, merged into severity matrix, evidence phase=scan logged per phase. Tier-required phase not attempted is BLOCKED (W001 tool unavailable / W002 git history failure are warnings, not blocks).

Commit: `"odyssey-security({slug}): SCAN — {tier} tier scan complete"`

**A_REPORT** — (1) Produce severity matrix: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with file:line references and remediation for each finding. (2) Compute summary statistics. (3) Write understanding.md §5 (full report). (4) Write `session.json.findings_count`. (5) Evidence phase=report. Mark G3.

**GATE: report-produced** — severity matrix with file:line references and remediation for every finding; summary statistics computed; §5 written; `audit_result` populated.

Commit: `"odyssey-security({slug}): REPORT — severity matrix produced"`

---

## Generalize Source

Security findings with severity >= medium + vulnerability patterns across scan phases.

**Discover routing:** sibling module with same vulnerability class → S_SCAN (re-scan expanded scope); new critical finding → evidence phase=decision, recommend `--mode improve`.

---

## Knowledge Persistence (§7)

Follow-up = governed candidate staging, NEVER a direct corpus write: `maestro knowledge stage spec "<title>" --content-file <path|-> --run {run_id} --category <cat>` (stage BEFORE seal; promote only after seal with a fresh receipt).


| Category | Content | Follow-up |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Vulnerability pattern | CWE + trigger + detection pattern + remediation | `stage spec → debug` |
| Security constraint | Trust boundary + validation rule + enforcement | `stage spec → arch` |
| Dependency risk | Package + CVE + safe version + migration path | `stage spec → coding` |
| CI/CD hardening | Misconfiguration + fix + prevention check | `stage spec → coding` |

- **Scan gate** (S_SCAN): all tier-required phases completed. Per-phase evidence logged. Findings merged with severity classification. Tier-required phase missing is BLOCKED (W001/W002 partial allowed).
- **Report gate** (S_REPORT): severity matrix produced with file:line + remediation. Summary statistics. §5 written. Read-only invariant verified (no source modifications in session).
