# Codex Run Adapter

This adapter extends `@~/.maestro/workflows/run-mode.md` for Codex skills. The canonical Run contract remains authoritative.

## Codex Execution Surfaces

- Preserve Codex-native tools and orchestration: direct execution, collaboration agents, `spawn_agents_on_csv`, `request_user_input`, goal APIs, and structured tool schemas.
- **CSV Wave is optional, never the default compliance shape.** Select the smallest execution surface that matches the task:
  - Direct execution for one bounded task that does not benefit from delegation.
  - `spawn_agent` + `wait_agent` for heterogeneous, iterative, or low-count independent work. Every spawned agent must be joined; continue waiting when the first wait times out.
  - `spawn_agents_on_csv` for homogeneous row-oriented batches with a stable input/output schema and enough items to justify CSV orchestration. Set `max_runtime_seconds: 3600` explicitly.
- Do not create `tasks.csv`, waves, or CSV state solely to satisfy an authoring template.
- When CSV Wave is selected, master state, wave inputs, and intermediate results are temporary computation. Store them under `{run_dir}/work/csv-wave/`.
- All formal artifacts (including evidence-role outputs) MUST be stored at their declared `{run_dir}/outputs/...` paths.
- Informal worker traces and cross-worker discoveries may use `{run_dir}/evidence/` (lazily created, not gate-checked).
- Human-readable synthesis and handoff belong in `{run_dir}/report.md`.

## Authority and Completion

- The skill frontmatter `contract` is the output schema and alias authority. Domain examples in the body MUST NOT create a second artifact registry or output root.
- Never edit `.workflow/state.json`, Session identity, Execution, or Run protocol JSON. Resolve inputs only from the canonical `upstream` map returned by `maestro run create`, `maestro run next`, or `maestro run brief`.
- When CSV Wave is selected, every CSV worker MUST call `report_agent_job_result` exactly once. Workers do not mutate protocol files or orchestrator-owned CSV files.
- Finish domain work with `maestro run check {run_id} --session {session_id}`. An executor without mutation authority returns to the dispatching coordinator and MUST NOT complete or advance the Run. A self-started coordinator follows canonical `run-mode.md`: complete with `maestro run complete ... --participant {participant_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {request_id} --reason "<reason>" --expected-orchestration-revision {orchestration_revision} --expected-run-revision {run_revision} --verdict {done|done_with_concerns} --advance --json`, then finish the Session with `maestro session complete ... --json`. Every mutation consumes `run-response/1.2` and refreshes the exact locator/`orchestration_revision`; Session lifecycle aliases and the Execution-era surface (`execution start/resume/seal`, core lease) are legacy compatibility only. Read the completion receipt and apply the Review Presentation Protocol. Sealed Runs are immutable.

## Legacy `session/1.x/2.x` Compatibility Branch

旧 Codex 适配面（显式选择旧 CLI/schema 时）：coordinator 以 Execution-aware `maestro run complete ... --execution {execution_id} --generation {generation} --expected-execution-revision {execution_revision} ... --json` 完成 Run，再用 `maestro execution seal ... --json` 封存 bounded generation；mutation 消费 `run-response/1.1` 并刷新 locator/fence，且 executor 需持有 private core lease claim。deprecated/legacy-only。
