# Codex Run Adapter

This adapter extends `@~/.maestro/workflows/run-mode.md` for Codex skills. The canonical Run contract remains authoritative.

## Codex Execution Surfaces

- Preserve Codex-native tools and orchestration: direct execution, collaboration agents, `spawn_agents_on_csv`, `request_user_input`, goal APIs, and structured tool schemas.
- **CSV Wave is optional, never the default compliance shape.** Select the smallest execution surface that matches the task:
  - Direct execution for one bounded task that does not benefit from delegation.
  - `spawn_agent` + `wait_agent` for heterogeneous, iterative, or low-count independent work. Every spawned agent must be joined; continue waiting when the first wait times out.
  - `spawn_agents_on_csv` for homogeneous row-oriented batches with a stable input/output schema and enough items to justify CSV orchestration. Set `max_runtime_seconds: 3600` explicitly.
- Do not create `tasks.csv`, waves, or CSV state solely to satisfy an authoring template.
- When CSV Wave is selected, master state, wave inputs, and intermediate results are temporary computation. Store them under `{run_dir}/work/csv-wave/`.
- All formal artifacts (including evidence-role outputs) MUST be stored at their declared `{run_dir}/outputs/...` paths.
- Informal worker traces and cross-worker discoveries may use `{run_dir}/evidence/` (lazily created, not gate-checked).
- Human-readable synthesis and handoff belong in `{run_dir}/report.md`.

## Authority and Completion

- The skill frontmatter `contract` is the output schema and alias authority. Domain examples in the body MUST NOT create a second artifact registry or output root.
- Never edit `.workflow/state.json` artifact arrays or Session protocol JSON. Resolve inputs from the `upstream` map returned by `maestro run create`.
- When CSV Wave is selected, every CSV worker MUST call `report_agent_job_result` exactly once. Workers do not mutate protocol files or orchestrator-owned CSV files.
- Finish with `maestro run check {run_id}` and `maestro run complete {run_id}`. When every gate is clean, `run check` emits a `finish` checklist (handoff, knowledge record, conflict marking, verdict, workflow-declared norms) — work through it before completing. Sealed artifacts are immutable.
