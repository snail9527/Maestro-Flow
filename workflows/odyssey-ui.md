# Workflow: Odyssey UI

6-dimension visual experience audit — survey design context → audit dimensions → divergent exploration → fix → verify → generalize.

---

## State Chain

```
S_INTAKE → S_SURVEY → S_AUDIT → S_DIVERGE → S_FIX → S_VERIFY → [back-half]
```

Back-half: `S_GENERALIZE → S_DISCOVER → S_RECORD → END` (see odyssey-base.md §Shared Back-Half).

---

## Boundary

**In scope:** Target component/page visual experience optimization — audit 6 dimensions, divergent exploration, fix, generalize to sibling components.
**Out of scope:** Backend/data/API → `--mode planex` | Deep bug investigation → `--mode debug` | Code quality review → `--mode review`.

---

## Decision Gate

ONLY these qualify as decisions: brand/style direction requiring human creative judgment | layout restructuring that significantly changes user flow | requires new design tokens or breaking component API.

## Context

### Target Resolution

| Input | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Component path | Audit component |
| Page/route | Audit page |
| `staged` / `HEAD` | Diff UI changes |
| Feature area | Resolve to components/pages |

### Dimensions (6)

| Dimension | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| visual_hierarchy | Spacing, typography scale, color contrast, alignment, whitespace, visual weight |
| interaction_states | Hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, empty, selected states |
| accessibility | WCAG AA contrast, focus management, aria labels, keyboard nav, screen reader |
| responsiveness | Breakpoints, overflow, touch targets, fluid typography, container queries |
| micro_interactions | Transitions, animations, feedback indicators, loading states, progress |
| edge_cases | Long text truncation, empty data, error states, extreme values, i18n, RTL |

### Session Fields

```json

## State Machine

### Transitions

```
S_SURVEY  → S_AUDIT       : complete
S_AUDIT   → S_DIVERGE     : complete
S_DIVERGE → S_FIX         : !skip_fix AND actionable findings/ideas
S_DIVERGE → S_GENERALIZE  : (skip_fix OR no actionable) AND !skip_generalize
S_DIVERGE → S_RECORD      : (skip_fix OR no actionable) AND skip_generalize
S_FIX     → S_VERIFY      : fix implemented
S_VERIFY  → S_GENERALIZE  : verified, !skip_generalize
S_VERIFY  → S_RECORD      : verified, skip_generalize
S_VERIFY  → S_FIX         : needs_rework
```

Discover routes: new component to audit → S_AUDIT; fixable sibling → S_FIX.

### Actions

**A_SURVEY** — (1) Design system inventory: scan for design tokens, CSS variables, theme imports. (2) Current state analysis: styling patterns, layout strategy, component hierarchy. (3) CLI-assisted: `maestro delegate --role analyze --mode analysis` (`run_in_background: true`) — survey tokens, spacing, typography, hierarchy, consistency. (4) Evidence phase=survey. Update §2. Mark G1.

Commit: `"odyssey-ui({slug}): SURVEY — design context survey complete"`

**A_AUDIT** — Spawn 6 parallel Agents (one per dimension, or `--dimensions` subset; see Dimensions table). Each returns `[{title, severity, file, line, description, suggestion, dimension}]`. Merge → evidence phase=audit. Write `audit_result`. Update §3 severity matrix. Mark G2.

**GATE: all-dimensions-audited** — all 6 dimensions (or `--dimensions` subset) completed with structured findings, merged into severity matrix, evidence phase=audit logged per dimension. Zero dimensions reviewed is BLOCKED (W002 partial from agent failure is a warning).

Commit: `"odyssey-ui({slug}): AUDIT — dimension audit complete"`

**A_DIVERGE** — Goes beyond defect fixing — "what would make this delightful?"

**Step 1 — 2 parallel Agents:**
- **Polish Agent**: shadows, borders, transitions, hover, feedback, empty states, skeleton loading, scroll behavior.
- **Delight Agent**: motion design, progressive disclosure, smart defaults, contextual hints, celebratory feedback, personality in copy.

Each returns `[{idea, category (polish|delight), impact, effort, description, inspiration}]`.

**Step 2 — CLI-assisted:** `maestro delegate --role analyze --mode analysis` (`run_in_background: true`) — polish opportunities, micro-interactions, visual rhythm, delight moments.

**Step 3 — Consolidate:** merge audit findings + divergent ideas → prioritized list (severity × impact × effort). Evidence phase=diverge. Update §4. Mark G3.

**GATE: diverge-explored** — both Polish and Delight agents completed, returning distinct `[{idea, category, impact, effort, description, inspiration}]` entries; CLI-assisted analysis completed; all outputs consolidated with audit findings into a prioritized list (severity × impact × effort); evidence phase=diverge logged; understanding.md §4 written.

Commit: `"odyssey-ui({slug}): DIVERGE — divergent exploration complete"`

**A_FIX** — Skip if `--skip-fix`. (1) Exhaustive fix: ALL findings/ideas by priority tier (critical → high → medium → low + high-impact ideas). After each tier, re-review — new findings append. (2) Each fix → evidence phase=fix. (3) Normal: [@ask] AskUserQuestion per-fix | `-y`: auto-proceed, record `deferred`.

Commit: `"odyssey-ui({slug}): FIX — {tier} tier addressed"`

**A_VERIFY** — (1) Run tests (lint, unit, visual regression). (2) `maestro delegate --role review --mode analysis` (`run_in_background: true`) — visual correctness, interaction states, accessibility, responsive. (3) `needs_rework` → S_FIX; `verified` → mark G4. Update §5, write `confirmation`.

**GATE: zero-remaining-verified** — every prioritized finding and idea is fixed and verified, individually classified (issue / decision), or skipped via `--skip-fix`; tests pass (lint, unit, visual regression); confirmation written; no unaddressed actionable findings; understanding.md §5 updated. `needs_rework` routes back to FIX.

Commit: `"odyssey-ui({slug}): VERIFY — fix verification complete"`

## Generalize Source

Audit findings + diverge ideas (severity >= medium OR impact = high).

**Discover routing:** new component → S_AUDIT; fixable sibling → S_FIX.

## Phase Gates

- **Discovery gate** (SURVEY): evidence logged, understanding.md updated. Survey requires all scan types attempted.
- **Audit gate** (AUDIT+DIVERGE): all dimension agents completed, findings merged. Diverge agents completed, ideas consolidated. Zero dimensions reviewed is BLOCKED (W002 partial allowed).
- **FIX gate:** current priority tier fully addressed. Per-fix evidence logged. Auto-commit per tier.
- **VERIFY gate:** tests pass; confirmation written, understanding.md updated, verify goal marked. needs_rework → route back to FIX.
