<purpose>
Unified brainstorming combining interactive framework generation, multi-role parallel analysis, and cross-role synthesis. Two modes: Auto (full pipeline with guidance-specification → parallel role analysis → synthesis) and Single Role (individual role analysis for an existing session). Outputs structured artifacts in .brainstorming/ directory ready for downstream planning.
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- topic text for auto mode, or role name for single role mode.

**Auto mode**: topic text (e.g., "Build real-time collaboration platform") triggers full pipeline.
**Single role mode**: valid role name (e.g., "system-architect") runs one role analysis.
**All output** goes to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-brainstorm-{slug}/`.
**Artifact registration**: On completion, registers artifact (type=brainstorm) in state.json.
**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target `{output_dir}/` or `.workflow/state.json` only. NEVER modify source code or files outside these paths.

**Valid roles**: data-architect, product-manager, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, system-architect, test-strategist, ui-designer, ux-expert

**Flags**:
- `--yes` / `-y`: Auto mode, skip interactive questions, use defaults
- `--count N`: Number of roles to select (default 3, max 9)
- `--session ID`: Use existing session
- `--update`: Update existing analysis (single role)
- `--skip-questions`: Skip context gathering questions
- `--include-questions`: Force context gathering even if analysis exists
- `--style-skill PKG`: Style package for ui-designer role

### Pre-load specs
1. **Architecture specs**: Run `maestro spec load --category arch` to load architecture constraints. Use as context for multi-role analysis — ensures roles respect documented decisions.
2. Optional — proceed without if unavailable.

### Role Knowledge
1. Browse accumulated knowledge for this role:
   `maestro wiki list --category arch`
2. Analyze the index, identify entries relevant to the current task
3. Load selected documents:
   `maestro wiki load <id1> [id2] [id3...]`
4. Review loaded knowledge before proceeding
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/brainstorm.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**

Auto mode:
- Project not initialized → Skill({ skill: "maestro-init" })
- Project initialized, need spec package → Skill({ skill: "maestro-roadmap", args: "--mode full --from-brainstorm {session_id}" })
- Project initialized, quick roadmap → Skill({ skill: "maestro-roadmap", args: "--from-brainstorm {session_id}" })
- Need deeper analysis first → Skill({ skill: "maestro-analyze", args: "{topic}" })
- `html-prototypes/` produced with 2+ files and user wants to browse → load `~/.maestro/workflows/brainstorm-visualize.md` and launch visualizer server (optional, user-triggered)
- DESIGN.md established during Step 3.5 → suggest: "Run `/maestro-impeccable build <feature-description>` to build with the established design system"

Single role mode:
- More roles needed → Skill({ skill: "maestro-brainstorm", args: "{next_role} --session {session_id}" })
- All roles done, run synthesis → Skill({ skill: "maestro-brainstorm", args: "{topic} --session {session_id}" })
</execution>
