$ARGUMENTS — subcommand and optional flags.

**Subcommands:**
| Subcommand | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `health` | Health dashboard — score, broken links, orphans, hubs (default) |
| `search <query>` | Interactive BM25 search with follow-up actions |
| `cleanup` | Find and resolve orphans, broken links, stale entries |
| `stats` | Graph statistics — type distribution, tag frequency, growth trends |
| `connect` | Find and link hidden connections — orphan rescue, missing links, transitive gaps |
| `digest [topic]` | Generate knowledge digest with theme clustering and gap analysis |
| No args | Same as `health` |

**Flags:**
- `--type <type>` — Filter by wiki type: spec, knowhow, note, issue
- `--fix` — Auto-fix issues found during cleanup/connect (remove broken links, apply connections)
- `--json` — Output in JSON format
- `--min-similarity N` — (connect) Minimum similarity threshold for link candidates
- `--max N` — (connect) Maximum number of suggestions
- `--format brief|full` — (digest) Output format
- `--recent N` — (digest) Scope to N most recent entries
- `--create-issues` — (digest) Create issues for identified knowledge gaps
</context>

<execution>
**Subcommand routing:**
- `health|search|cleanup|stats` → Follow `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-manage.md` completely.
- `connect` → Follow `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-connect.md` completely (Stages 1-6).
- `digest` → Follow `~/.maestro/workflows/wiki-digest.md` completely (Stages 1-8).
</execution>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Description | Stage |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| E001 | fatal | `.workflow/` not initialized — run `/maestro-init` first | validate |
| E002 | fatal | No wiki entries found — create content first | load |
| E003 | error | Invalid subcommand | parse_input |
| W001 | warning | Health score below 50 — graph needs attention | health |
| W002 | warning | Orphan cleanup had partial failures | cleanup |
</error_codes>
