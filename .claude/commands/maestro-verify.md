<purpose>
Verify execution results through three complementary methods:
1. **Goal-Backward verification** — 3-layer check (Truths → Artifacts → Wiring) that validates goals are actually achieved
2. **Anti-pattern scan** — detect stubs, placeholders, TODO/FIXME, empty returns in modified files
3. **Nyquist test coverage validation** — requirement-to-test mapping with gap classification

Supports dual-level verification:
- **Single plan**: `verify --dir scratch/plan-xxx` — verifies one plan, writes `verification.json` into plan dir
- **Milestone**: `verify` (no args) — aggregates all execute artifacts for current milestone into `scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-verify-M{N}-{slug}/milestone-verification.json`

Registers VRF artifact in state.json on completion.

<deferred_reading>
- [verification.json](~/.maestro/templates/verification.json) — read when generating output
- [validation.json](~/.maestro/templates/validation.json) — read when generating test output

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — phase number or no args for milestone-wide, with optional flags.

Flags (`--skip-tests`, `--skip-antipattern`, `--dir`), scope routing, output paths, and VRF artifact registration schema are defined in workflow `verify.md`.

### Pre-load context (before verification)

1. **Codebase docs**: If `.workflow/codebase/` exists, read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for expected module wiring and `FEATURES.md` for component mapping. Use in Layer 3 (Connection) checks.
2. **Review specs**: Run `maestro spec load --category review` to load review standards. Use as quality baseline for anti-pattern scan and constraint checks.
3. **Wiki constraints**: Run `maestro wiki search "architecture constraint" --json 2>/dev/null`. If results found, include documented invariants as additional truth checks in Layer 1.
4. **Role Knowledge**:
   - Browse: `maestro wiki list --category review`
   - Load task-relevant entries: `maestro wiki load <id1> [id2...]`
5. All are optional — proceed without if unavailable.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/verify.md' completely.

### Post-verify Knowledge Inquiry

| Condition | Ask | Route |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Anti-pattern blockers found (TODO/FIXME/stubs) | "Update quality-rules.md?" | spec-add quality |
| Architecture constraint violations | "Update architecture-constraints.md?" | spec-add arch |
| Recurring test coverage gap (same module across tasks) | "Add to test-conventions.md?" | spec-add test |

On confirm → `Skill("spec-add", "<category> <content>")`.

**Next-step routing on completion:**
- All checks pass, no gaps → /quality-review
- Gaps found (must-have failures or anti-pattern blockers) → /maestro-plan --gaps
- Low test coverage (Nyquist gaps) → /quality-auto-test

**Gap-fix closure loop:**
Gaps found → maestro-plan --gaps → maestro-execute → maestro-verify (re-run)

**Completion status:**
```
--- COMPLETION STATUS ---
STATUS: DONE|DONE_WITH_CONCERNS|NEEDS_RETRY
CONCERNS: {description if applicable}
NEXT: /quality-review
--- END STATUS ---
```

Status mapping:
- **DONE** — All checks pass, no gaps → NEXT: /quality-review
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Gaps found (must-have failures or anti-pattern blockers) → NEXT: /maestro-execute (after /maestro-plan --gaps)
- **NEEDS_RETRY** — Verification could not complete (missing artifacts, corrupt data)
</execution>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | No executed plans found for verification | Run maestro-execute first |
| E002 | error | Plan directory not found | Check --dir path |
| E003 | error | No execution results found (missing summaries) | Run maestro-execute first |
| W001 | warning | Test coverage below configured threshold | Review coverage gaps |
| W002 | warning | Anti-pattern blockers found in modified files | Fix blockers before proceeding |
