<purpose>
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with workflow guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) via a shortened pipeline.
Flags --discuss and --full enable additional pipeline stages.

$ARGUMENTS

Parse for:
- `--full` flag -- Enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification
- `--discuss` flag -- Decision extraction before planning (gray areas, Locked/Free/Deferred classification)
- Remaining text as task description

### Pre-load context

1. **Coding specs + tools**: Run `maestro spec load --category coding` to load coding conventions and discoverable tools. Apply to implementation.
2. **UI specs (conditional)**: If the task involves frontend/UI work (description contains component, page, style, layout, CSS, HTML, frontend), also run `maestro spec load --category ui`.
3. **Role Knowledge**:
   - Browse: `maestro search --category coding`
   - Load task-relevant entries: `maestro wiki load <id1> [id2...]`
3. All are optional — proceed without if unavailable.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/quick.md' completely.

### Artifact Verification (before completion)

```
REQUIRED_ARTIFACTS = [
  "plan.json",                              // Task definitions
  ".summaries/TASK-*-summary.md" (per task)  // Execution results
]
```
If any artifact is missing: DO NOT report completion. Complete the missing step first.

Task summaries MUST include concrete evidence of completion (files changed, tests run, commands executed) — not just "task completed successfully."

</execution>

<completion>
### Next-step routing
| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Task done, --full verification passed | `/manage-status` |
| Task done, verification found gaps | `/quality-debug {issue}` |
| Task done, want to sync docs | `/quality-sync` |
| Need a full phase workflow instead | `/maestro-plan {phase}` |
</completion>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | Task description required (no text provided) | Check arguments format, re-run with correct input |
| E002 | error | Scratch directory creation failed | Check disk space and .workflow/ permissions |
| W001 | warning | Verification found minor gaps | Review gaps and determine if they need fixing |
</error_codes>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Scratch task directory created under .workflow/scratch/
- [ ] plan.json written with task definitions
- [ ] All tasks executed with summaries written
- [ ] state.json updated with scratch task entry
- [ ] Commit created with task changes
</success_criteria>
