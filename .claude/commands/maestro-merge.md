<purpose>
Merge a milestone worktree branch back into main, sync scratch artifacts, and reconcile the artifact registry.
Two-phase: git merge first, artifact sync second (only after git succeeds).
</purpose>

<required_reading>
@~/.maestro/workflows/merge.md
</required_reading>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- milestone number and optional flags.

Flags (`-m`, `--force`, `--dry-run`, `--no-cleanup`, `--continue`), merge sequence, artifact sync detail, and conflict handling are defined in workflow `merge.md`.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/merge.md' completely.

### Phase Gates (MANDATORY, BLOCKING)

**GATE 1: Pre-merge → Git Merge**
- REQUIRED: Registry health check completed (stale entries cleaned or flagged).
- REQUIRED: Pre-merge rebase successful (worktree has latest main).
- BLOCKED if rebase has conflicts: resolve in worktree first (W003).

**GATE 2: Git Merge → Artifact Sync**
- REQUIRED: Git merge completed without conflicts (or conflicts resolved via --continue).
- BLOCKED if: merge has unresolved conflicts — do NOT sync artifacts until git merge succeeds (prevents partial state corruption).

**GATE 3: Artifact Sync → Completion**
- REQUIRED: All scratch artifacts synced to main `.workflow/scratch/`.
- REQUIRED: `state.json.artifacts[]` reconciled (worktree entries merged into main).
- REQUIRED: Worktree cleaned up (unless --no-cleanup).
- BLOCKED if missing: artifacts not synced or registry not reconciled — main worktree would have incomplete state.

</execution>

<completion>
### Knowledge inquiry

After successful merge, ask user once: "Record milestone learnings?" If yes, persist via `Skill("spec-add", "learning \"<title>\" \"<insight>\" --keywords <kw1>,<kw2> --description \"<summary>\"")`.

### Next-step routing

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | Running inside a worktree | Run from main worktree |
| E002 | error | No worktree registry found | Nothing to merge |
| E003 | error | --continue but no merge state | Start fresh merge |
| E004 | error | No milestone number provided | Provide `-m <N>` |
| W001 | warning | Stale registry entries found | Auto-cleaned |
| W002 | warning | Incomplete artifacts (without --force) | Confirm or use --force |
| W003 | warning | Conflict pulling main into worktree | Resolve in worktree first |
