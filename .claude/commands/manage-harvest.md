<purpose>
Extract knowledge from workflow artifacts → route to wiki/spec/issue stores. Works on any artifact (vs retrospective which is phase-scoped).
</purpose>

<required_reading>
@~/.maestro/workflows/harvest.md
</required_reading>

<deferred_reading>
- @~/.maestro/workflows/issue.md (issues.jsonl schema for issue routing — read when creating issues in Stage 6c)
- @~/.maestro/workflows/specs-add.md (spec entry format — read when routing to spec in Stage 6b)
</deferred_reading>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Modes (auto-detected):**
- No arguments → `scan` mode: discover all harvestable artifacts, interactive selection
- `<session-id>` (e.g., `ANL-auth-20260410`, `WFS-xxx`) → `session` mode: harvest specific session
- `<path>` (e.g., `.workflow/.analysis/ANL-auth-20260410/`) → `path` mode: harvest from explicit directory

Flags, source registry (scan paths), and storage locations defined in workflow harvest.md.
</context>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/harvest.md' Stages 1-8 in order.

**Key invariants:**
1. **Read-only until Stage 6** — extraction and classification happen in-memory.
2. **Dedup before write** — check harvest-log.jsonl and existing stores before each write.
3. **Never modify source artifacts** — harvest is purely extractive.
4. **Dedup contract with parallel writers** — when appending to `issues.jsonl`, set `source: "harvest"` on each row so concurrent writers (e.g. `manage-issue-discover` with `source: "discover"`) can be distinguished and deduplicated.

Extraction patterns, classification rules, routing infrastructure, and fragment ID scheme defined in workflow harvest.md.

### Next-step routing

| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Wiki entries created | `maestro wiki list --type note` |
| Wiki graph needs linking | `/manage-wiki connect --fix` |
| Issues created | `/manage-issue list --source harvest` |
| Specs extracted | `/spec-load --role implement` |
| Full phase retrospective | `/quality-retrospective` |
</completion>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | `.workflow/` not initialized | Run `/maestro-init` first |
| E002 | error | Invalid `--to` target (must be: wiki, spec, issue, auto) | Display valid options |
| E003 | error | Invalid `--source` type | Display valid source types from registry |
| E004 | error | Session ID not found in any source path | Show available sessions with `--source all` |
| E005 | error | Path does not exist or contains no parseable artifacts | Verify path and file structure |
| W001 | warning | No harvestable artifacts found within `--recent` window | Widen time window or check `.workflow/` contents |
| W002 | warning | `maestro wiki create` failed — wiki entries saved to `.workflow/harvest/wiki-pending-*.md` | Apply pending entries manually or retry |
| W003 | warning | Some fragments below confidence threshold — logged but not routed | Lower `--min-confidence` to include |
| W004 | warning | Duplicate fragments skipped | Review harvest-log.jsonl for prior routing |
| W005 | warning | `.workflow/issues/` directory missing | Auto-create directory and empty issues.jsonl |
