<purpose>
Unified interactive entry for all development intents. Pure router: parse intent + project state → classify → assess complexity → route to the appropriate channel:
- **Companion** (lightweight): route to `/maestro-companion "<intent>"` — minimal run lifecycle, continuous evidence recording
- **Standard** (single run): recommend a step → confirm → execute via a v3 Session (`maestro session open` + `maestro run next`)
- **Multi-step**: route to `/maestro "<intent>"` (manual stepwise control) or `/maestro-ralph "<intent>"` (orchestrated closed-loop)

This command is the single entry point. It classifies and routes. Multi-step execution loops live in `/maestro` (manual) and `/maestro-ralph` (orchestrated).
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — intent text + optional flags.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `-y` / `--yes` | Skip confirmation. Auto-executes only the **standard** channel; for companion/multi-step it emits the target invocation (router semantics — the target command owns execution) |

**Mode detection (priority order):**
1. Intent text present → S_STATE → S_RANK → route by complexity verdict
2. "continue"/"next"/"go" → lifecycle inference for natural next step
3. No arguments at all → 1 clarify round

**Candidate pool:** All 14 first-tier steps registered in `prepare/` + `workflows/`. Companion is a routing channel, not a first-tier step. Pipeline orchestrators (`maestro`, `maestro-ralph*`) are NEVER in the candidate pool.
</context>

<invariants>
1. **Pure router for multi-step** — this command never runs execution loops (manual chain or orchestrated). Multi-step execution is delegated to `/maestro` (manual) or `/maestro-ralph` (orchestrated)
2. **Pipeline orchestrators excluded** — only recommend registered steps as single-run targets
3. **Lifecycle continuation** — "continue"/"next"/"go" are explicit continuation signals → lifecycle_position inference (S_STATE). Truly empty arguments (no text at all) → 1 clarify round via [@ask] AskUserQuestion; still empty → S_FALLBACK (E001)
4. **Literal match priority** — keyword match takes precedence; lifecycle is tie-breaker
5. **Argument pass-through** — the intent phrase is Session metadata only (the objective to `session open`); the selected step's domain payload becomes command input through repeatable `--arg <value>`. The user can modify command inputs at confirmation; `-y` only passes through when the user provided it
6. **Manual campaigns excluded** — `team-*` and `maestro-odyssey` never enter the executable candidate pool and are never executed in this turn; they may only be emitted as suggest-only invocations (see the odyssey campaign rows in the intent routing table)
7. **Retained commands are suggest-only** — route retained commands to an exact slash command. Never execute them in this turn; `-y` applies only to first-tier steps
8. **Companion routing is suggest-or-execute** — when complexity == lightweight, output `/maestro-companion "<intent>"` invocation. With `-y`, emit the invocation directly (`/maestro-companion "<intent>" -y`); the companion command owns its own execution. Without `-y`, present it as the recommended channel for user confirmation
9. **Multi-step routes to the orchestrators** — when intent spans ≥2 steps or needs orchestration, output `/maestro "<intent>"` (manual stepwise) or `/maestro-ralph "<intent>"` (orchestrated closed-loop). This command never creates sessions or manages chains itself
10. **Cross-category keyword priority** — when an intent keyword matches both a first-tier step and a retained command, the first-tier step wins for candidate selection; complexity assessment still applies independently. Auxiliary clusters are advisory grouping for display, never routing overrides
11. **`-y` means skip-confirmation, not auto-execute** — for standard channel, skipping confirmation proceeds to S_EXECUTE (this command runs the step). For companion/multi-step channels, this command is a router: skipping confirmation means outputting the target invocation text directly. The target command owns its own execution semantics

### A_INFER_LIFECYCLE

Read project state to infer `lifecycle_position`:

```bash
maestro session list 2>/dev/null   # read-only: enumerate session/3.0 Sessions
cat .workflow/state.json 2>/dev/null
```

**State → lifecycle_position → natural next step:**

| State | lifecycle_position | Natural next |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| No `.workflow/` + no source code | brainstorm | brainstorm |
| No `.workflow/` + has source code | init | (maestro-init, not a step) |
| state.json exists, no roadmap, no sessions | analyze-macro | analyze |
| Has macro analysis, no roadmap | roadmap | roadmap |
| Has roadmap, dep-ready session unstarted | analyze | analyze --session {slug} |
| Latest artifact = analysis | plan | plan --session {active} |
| Latest artifact = plan | execute | execute --session {active} |
| Latest artifact = execution | review | review --session {active} |
| Review verdict = PASS | auto-test | auto-test --session {active} |
| Tests green + active session | session-seal | (maestro-session-seal, not a step) |
| Any stage has gaps/failures | debug | debug {gap} |

**Lifecycle main line:**
```
init → {brainstorm | blueprint | analyze-macro} → roadmap
  → [per session] analyze → plan → execute
  → [quality gate] review → auto-test → test
  → session-seal → next dep-ready session
```

**Multi-session resolution:** "Latest artifact" refers to the `active_session_id` in state.json. If no active session is set, use the most recently modified session. If multiple sessions are active, lifecycle inference applies only to the active one; surface others as context in S_PRESENT.

### A_SCORE_CANDIDATES

**Scoring signals (high → low):**

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Intent keyword match | High | Literal match against routing table |
| Lifecycle natural next | High | Decisive when intent is empty/"continue" |
| Step name keyword match | Medium | Intent contains "test" → test/auto-test boosted |
| Workflow cluster match | Medium | Learning/knowledge/issue clusters |
| Recent activity avoidance | Low | Recently completed steps demoted |
| Precondition unmet | Exclude | Remove from pool entirely |

**Complexity assessment (determines channel):**

| Complexity | Channel | Criteria |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Lightweight | `/maestro-companion` | Mechanically clear intent, no design decisions, no artifact handoff, no gate value |
| Standard | Single step (one run) | Produces typed artifacts, needs downstream handoff or gate checks |
| Multi-step (manual) | `/maestro` | Intent spans ≥2 distinct steps, user wants stepwise control, no auto-retry needed |
| Multi-step (orchestrated) | `/maestro-ralph` | Intent needs closed-loop: decision nodes, drift analysis, auto-retry, decomposition |

**Routing preference: prefer the lightest channel that satisfies the task.** Default to Companion for anything that looks like a quick fix/lookup/exploration. Only upgrade to Standard when there is concrete evidence the task produces artifacts a downstream step will consume, or needs a gate/verdict for lifecycle tracking. Only route to /maestro when the intent genuinely spans ≥2 distinct lifecycle steps. When in doubt between Companion and Standard, ask the user via the confirmation menu rather than auto-upgrading.

**Lightweight signals (all must hold):**
- Intent specifies a concrete, bounded action — the user names what to change and where (file, function, error message). "Fix the login bug" is NOT lightweight (unbounded diagnosis); "change the timeout from 30s to 60s in auth.ts" IS lightweight. File count is irrelevant; a 20-file rename with a known pattern is still lightweight
- No typed artifact needs to be consumed by a downstream step
- No gate/verdict needs to be recorded for lifecycle tracking
- Task does not require pre-task thinking (prepare) or structured brief to execute correctly
- Single concern — intent does not span multiple lifecycle phases (e.g., analyze+plan, execute+review)

**Multi-step detection:** intent matches keywords of ≥2 distinct steps in the routing table → classify the relationship before setting `multi_step`:

| Pattern | Classification | Channel |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Sequential lifecycle steps ("analyze then plan", "review and fix") | Multi-step | `/maestro` or `/maestro-ralph` |
| Single action with multiple aspects ("review and improve the auth module") | Single intent, pick dominant step | Standard or Companion |
| Ambiguous compound ("test and deploy") | Present both as alternatives in S_CONFIRM | — |

Dominant step = the step whose keyword appears first or carries the primary verb. When in doubt, present both as alternatives rather than auto-selecting.

**Orchestrator selection (for multi-step routing):**
- `/maestro` (manual): user explicitly asks for stepwise/per-step control ("one step at a time", "confirm each step"), or intent is a simple sequential pipeline of ≤3 steps without quality gates
- `/maestro-ralph` (orchestrated, default): intent implies iterative quality convergence — broad refactoring (>5 files), migration, "end-to-end", "full lifecycle", or needs decision gates/drift analysis/auto-retry. When in doubt, default to `/maestro-ralph`

**Override flags:**
- Channel is auto-detected from the signals above; the verdict is shown to the user before routing, and the user may override the channel at the confirmation menu (S_CONFIRM).

**Intent routing table:** first-tier rows enter the executable candidate pool. Retained-command rows are advisory routes: show the exact slash command and stop.

> **Cross-category priority:** first-tier step keywords take precedence over retained-command keywords when both match. Example: "security test" → `test` (first-tier) wins over `security/OWASP` (odyssey campaign), unless the intent explicitly says "security audit" or "OWASP". Auxiliary cluster triggers are the lowest priority — they group retained commands for display but never override individual keyword matches.

> **Scope guard:** keyword match identifies the *candidate step*, but the complexity verdict still applies independently. A keyword hit does NOT override lightweight signals. Example: "rename this variable" matches `execute/implement` keywords → candidate = execute step, but complexity = lightweight (1 file, no handoff) → channel = `/maestro-companion`. The routing table answers "which step?", the complexity assessment answers "which channel?".

| Intent keywords | Recommended step | What it does |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| brainstorm / ideate / what-if / perspectives / multi-role | brainstorm | Multi-role creative exploration with cross-role conflict resolution |

| note / record observation during active Run | `maestro knowledge stage knowhow "<title>" "<content>" --run <run-id>` | Stage a reviewable candidate; do not direct-write project knowledge |
| promote / distill insights | `maestro knowledge review <session-id>` → `maestro knowledge promote ...` | Review candidate receipts and evidence before explicit promotion |

**Auxiliary workflow clusters:**

| Cluster | Trigger | Chain |
|---------|---------|-------|

| Knowledge | Review & promote experience | knowledge stage (--signal) → knowledge review --refresh --resolve → knowledge promote |
| Issue | Defect management | maestro-issue discover → maestro-issue |

### A_EXECUTE_STEP

Single-run path only. Multi-step execution is handled by `/maestro` (manual) and `/maestro-ralph` (orchestrated).

For first-tier steps (those with prepare/ + workflows/ files):

```bash
# 1. Open the Session — prepare guidance is injected by Runtime into the birth packet
#    (prepare is embedded in the Run, not a standalone `run prepare` step):
maestro session open "<objective>" --id YYYYMMDD-<step>-<topic> --chain <step> --participant {participant_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {request_id} --reason "<reason>" --json
#    Or attach an existing compatible Session read-only first: maestro session status --session {session_id} --json

# 2. LLM performs pre-task thinking using the injected prepare guidance
#    Produces prep YAML (goal/approach/scope/risks/gates/reads)

# 3. Dispatch the step Run (chain-bound); --arg passes each required command input:
maestro run next --session {session_id} --participant {participant_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {request_id} --reason "<reason>" --expected-orchestration-revision {orchestration_revision} --json
#    (Self-started alternative: maestro run create <step> [args...] --session {session_id} ... --json)
#    Returns: run_id, run_dir, upstream (alias→artifact), entry_gates, entry_blockers, next (progressive hint)

# 3a. Entry blocker degradation (execute-specific)
#    IF step == execute AND entry_blockers is non-empty (missing current-plan):
#      Inspect upstream for alternative artifacts (latest-review, latest-debug, latest-fix-directions).
#      Route per the degradation table in prepare/execute.md:
#        - Small scope (≤3 findings, ≤2 files each) → transition/cancel the attempt, surface /maestro-companion
#        - Larger scope → transition/cancel the attempt, surface /odyssey-planex
#        - No alternative upstream → `maestro run transition {run_id} blocked`, surface E001 + suggest /plan
#      The chain step returns to pending; a later fenced `maestro run next` may retry it.
#      Do NOT proceed to step 4 with a blocked execute run.

# 3b. Entry blocker handling (general, non-execute steps)
#    IF step != execute AND entry_blockers is non-empty:
#      Display each blocker with recovery suggestion:
#        - Missing upstream artifact → suggest the producing step (e.g., "run analyze first")
#        - Gate failure → suggest the gate step (review/verify/auto-test)
#      `maestro run transition {run_id} blocked` (or `maestro run cancel {run_id}`) — do NOT proceed to step 4.

# 4. Load the execution manual (follow the birth packet `guidance`/`brief.command` from step 3)
#    Execute the birth packet guidance verbatim — append no flag.
#    Returns: workflow content, run-mode summary, goal, gate status

# 5. LLM executes the workflow (core process)

# 6. Check and complete the run
maestro run check {run_id} --session {session_id} --json
maestro run complete {run_id} --session {session_id} --participant {participant_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {request_id} --reason "<reason>" --expected-orchestration-revision {orchestration_revision} --expected-run-revision {run_revision} --verdict done --advance --json
```

After `run complete --advance`: re-infer lifecycle and surface the natural next step as a continuation hint — stepwise multi-step work proceeds by re-invoking `/maestro-next` or `/maestro -c`.

For retained commands, output the exact slash command as a suggest-only result. Do not execute it, including under `-y`; the user invokes it explicitly in a subsequent message.
