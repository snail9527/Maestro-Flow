# Pre-task Thinking: review

## Purpose

Review is a read-only assessment of `current-execution`'s change manifest. Before starting, establish awareness of this round's scope and existing constraints.

## Input Interpretation

The review level determines dimension coverage and execution method, inferred automatically by changed-file count by default:

| Level | Trigger | Dimensions | Execution |
|-------|---------|------------|-----------|
| quick | `--level quick` or small scope | correctness, security | inline scan, no agents dispatched |
| standard | default | all 6 dimensions | parallel agents |
| deep | `--level deep` or large scope / critical session | all 6 dimensions | parallel agents + mandatory deep-dive |

The six dimensions: correctness, security, performance, architecture, maintainability, best-practices. `--dimensions <list>` can override the level default.

## Required Context

Context injection (optional, may continue if missing):

- Architecture doc: `.workflow/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` → component boundaries, layering rules
- Wiki constraints: `maestro search "architecture constraint" --json` → recorded decisions
- Review specs: `maestro load --type spec --category review` → review standards, checklist, discoverable knowhow tools
- Conflict state: `maestro spec conflict list` → spec entries currently marked as conflicting (prioritize during review)
- Role knowledge: `maestro search --category review` → pick relevant items → `maestro load --type knowhow --id`

## Boundaries and Invariants

- Review is read-only on source — problems found are not fixed in this run; source modification belongs to the debug→plan→execute loop.
- Every finding must be anchored to `file:line` and carry severity, evidence, impact, recommendation; vague conclusions without anchors are forbidden.
- The verdict is driven by findings data; do not change severity based on user preference without new evidence.
- Each dimension produces findings independently; one dimension's result must not suppress or override another's.
- When a same-session `prior-review` exists, do a delta comparison; do not re-report already-resolved findings as new problems.
- When code and a spec entry contradict: if the code is evolved practice (spec is outdated), suggest `maestro spec supersede`; if there's a genuine dispute, `maestro spec conflict mark`; never silently accept the contradiction or edit the spec in place.

## Risk Checklist

- Is every finding anchored to `file:line` with severity, evidence, impact, recommendation? A vague finding without an anchor is not actionable.
- Is the verdict driven by findings data, not preference? Severity must not be softened without new evidence.
- Are dimensions genuinely independent? One dimension suppressing or overriding another's findings undermines coverage.
- On a re-review, did you delta against `prior-review`? Re-reporting already-resolved findings as new is noise.
- Did a code/spec contradiction get routed correctly? Evolved practice → `spec supersede`; genuine dispute → `spec conflict mark`; never silently accept or edit the spec in place.

## Gate Intent

- `dimension-coverage`: the dimensions required by the level all produced findings (quick = correctness + security; standard/deep = all 6), and each finding is anchored to `file:line` with severity/evidence/impact/recommendation.
- `severity-triaged`: every finding has a triaged severity and there are no unhandled UNMET spec-compliance criteria; the PASS/WARN/BLOCK verdict is driven by finding data, not preference.
