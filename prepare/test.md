# Pre-task Thinking: test

## Purpose

Testing is behavioral observation of a verified deliverable. Before starting, clarify the target scope, mode choice, and reusable test knowledge.

## Input Interpretation

Mode choice:

- **Default**: conversational UAT — present expected behavior scenario by scenario and ask the user whether reality matches.
- **`--frontend-verify`**: deterministic browser smoke — use chrome-devtools to assert UI entry points / write requests / DOM results one by one; this is **not** conversational UAT. See `ref/frontend-verify.md` for details.
- **`--smoke`**: run a cold-start smoke (startup, routing, build, dependencies) before UAT.
- **`--auto-fix`**: automatically orchestrate a gap-fix loop on failure.

Scenario source mapping — map multi-source inputs into UAT scenarios, each tagged with its `source`:

| Source | Tag | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| requirements / acceptance criteria | — | user-observable delivery criteria |
| registered test tools (knowhow) | `source: "tool"` | each numbered tool step → one UAT, assertion as expected |
| critical/high finding from `latest-review` | `source: "review_finding"` | when review verdict=BLOCK and such a scenario fails, automatically enter the gap-fix loop |
| root cause confirmed by `latest-debug` | `source: "debug_root_cause"` | generate a regression test scenario |

## Required Context

Context injection (optional, may continue if missing):

- Wiki: `maestro search "<scope/feature keywords>" --json` → existing test strategy, recipes, decisions
- Role knowledge: `maestro search --category test` → pick relevant items → `maestro load --type knowhow --id <id>`
- specs + tools: `maestro load --type spec --category test` → testing conventions + discoverable knowhow tools

## Boundaries and Invariants

- UAT is observational — test execution observes behavior and records results, not modifying source by default; source fixes belong to the debug→plan→execute loop.
- Present only one scenario at a time; batch presentation or guessing results is forbidden.
- Severity is **inferred** from the user's natural language, never explicitly asking for a level. See `ref/severity-inference.md` for the inference table.
- timeout, no response, or a missing UI entry point may not be judged as pass.
- `--frontend-verify` uses deterministic assertions; "nobody answered = all pass" is forbidden.
- The `--auto-fix` gap-fix loop is at most 2 rounds; persistent failure escalates to debug — do not retry indefinitely.
- When existing UAT progress exists, offer resume; do not silently overwrite.
- Write structured truth to `acceptance.json`/`test-results.json`, and process to `report.md`.

## Risk Checklist

- Is exactly one scenario presented at a time? Batch presentation or guessing outcomes fabricates results.
- Did any timeout / no-response / missing UI entry get judged as pass? None of these may be scored pass.
- Is severity inferred, not asked? The level comes from the user's natural language, never an explicit prompt for a rating.
- Is the auto-fix loop bounded? At most 2 rounds, then escalate to debug — no indefinite retrying.

## Gate Intent

- `coverage-met`: two components must both hold — (1) every mapped scenario source (requirements, tool steps, review findings, debug root causes) has a corresponding UAT scenario, and (2) the Readiness Gate passes (scenario_coverage ≥ 40%). `test-results.json` is written.
- `pass-rate-met`: each scenario has a real observed outcome (timeout / no-response / missing-entry may never be scored as pass); under `--frontend-verify`, any `[UI-observable]` failure or a write endpoint with no UI entry forces NEEDS_RETRY.
