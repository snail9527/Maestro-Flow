<purpose>
Structured second-opinion on code, decisions, or plans. Three modes:
- **review** (default): 3 parallel agents (pragmatist, purist, strategist)
- **challenge**: single adversarial agent — break assumptions, propose alternatives
- **consult**: interactive Q&A — agent studies target, answers your questions

Findings persist to `.workflow/specs/learnings.md` as `<spec-entry>` blocks.
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — target and optional mode flag.

**Target resolution** (auto-detected):
| Input | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| File path | Read file content |
| Wiki ID (`<type>-<slug>`) | `maestro wiki get <id>` |
| `HEAD` / `staged` | `git diff HEAD` / `git diff --staged` |
| Phase number | Resolve via state.json.artifacts[] → plan.json |

**Flags**: `--mode review|challenge|consult` (default: review)

**Pre-load** (optional): `Skill("spec-load")` for conventions + `maestro wiki search "<target topic>"` for related entries.

**Output**: `.workflow/knowhow/KNW-opinion-{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

### A_REVIEW
Spawn 3 Agents in single message:

| Agent | Focus | Question |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Pragmatist | simplicity, YAGNI, maintenance | "Simplest thing that works? Maintenance burden?" |
| Purist | correctness, edge cases, type safety | "What assumptions can be violated?" |
| Strategist | scalability, architecture alignment | "Supports future growth? Fits architecture?" |

Each returns: persona, verdict (approve/concern/reject), confidence, findings[{severity, description, location, suggestion}], summary.

### A_CHALLENGE
Spawn 1 adversarial Agent:
- Find weakest assumption
- Propose concrete breaking scenario
- Identify single biggest risk
- Suggest alternative approach
- Apply forcing questions: "What invalidates this?", "Simplest thing that breaks this?", "What would you regret in 6 months?", "What implicit contract isn't enforced?"

### A_CONSULT
Interactive loop:
1. Agent studies target
2. Display "Target loaded. What would you like to know?"
3. ask_question → Agent answers with code refs → repeat until "done"
4. Compile Q&A into report
