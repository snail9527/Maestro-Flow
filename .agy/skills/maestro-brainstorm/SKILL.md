<purpose>
Unified brainstorming combining interactive framework generation, multi-role parallel analysis, cross-role review, and resolution writeback. Two modes: Auto (full pipeline: guidance-specification → parallel {role}/ multi-file analysis → cross-role-reviewer compares Decision Digests for conflicts/gaps/synergies → user-confirmed resolutions patched into role files + logged in guidance §12) and Single Role (individual role analysis for an existing session). Outputs structured artifacts in `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-brainstorm-{slug}/` ready for downstream planning (roadmap / analyze / blueprint consume `guidance-specification.md`).

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- topic text for auto mode, or role name for single role mode.

**Auto mode**: topic text (e.g., "Build real-time collaboration platform") triggers full pipeline.
**Single role mode**: valid role name (e.g., "system-architect") runs one role analysis.
**All output** goes to `.workflow/scratch/{YYYYMMDD}-brainstorm-{slug}/` (orchestrator MUST resolve this to an absolute path before passing to sub-agents).
**Artifact registration**: On completion, registers artifact (type=brainstorm) in state.json.
**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target `{output_dir}/` or `.workflow/state.json` only. NEVER modify source code or files outside these paths.
**Produced files**: `guidance-specification.md`, `design-research.md` (optional), `{role}/analysis.md` + `{role}/analysis-F-*.md` + `{role}/findings-*.md` (per selected role).

**Valid roles**: data-architect, product-manager, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, system-architect, test-strategist, ui-designer, ux-expert

**Flags**:
- `--yes` / `-y`: Auto mode, skip interactive questions, use defaults
- `--count N`: Number of roles to select (default 3, max 9)
- `--session ID`: Use existing session
- `--update`: Update existing analysis (single role)
- `--skip-questions`: Skip context gathering questions
- `--include-questions`: Force context gathering even if analysis exists
- `--style-skill PKG`: Style package for ui-designer role

### Pre-load specs
1. **Architecture specs**: Run `maestro spec load --category arch` to load architecture constraints. Use as context for multi-role analysis — ensures roles respect documented decisions.
2. Optional — proceed without if unavailable.

### Role Knowledge
1. Browse accumulated knowledge for this role:
   `maestro wiki list --category arch`
2. Analyze the index, identify entries relevant to the current task
3. Load selected documents:
   `maestro wiki load <id1> [id2] [id3...]`
4. Review loaded knowledge before proceeding
</context>

<interview_protocol>
Interview the user relentlessly until shared understanding is reached. Active only in interactive mode; skip when `--yes/-y`, `--skip-questions`, `--session` (existing session), or input is already specific.

- One decision per turn via ask_question with 2–4 options + a (Recommended) default. The user controls termination — keep interviewing until convergence; they can interrupt naturally or via `Other` at any time.
- Search-first when uncertain: before asking, resolve via `state.json`, the session directory, `maestro spec load`, `maestro wiki search`, Glob/Grep/Read, or — for open-ended multi-file scans — spawn `invoke_subagent([{ TypeName: "<TypeName>", Role: "<Role>", Prompt: "<Prompt>", Workspace: "inherit" }])` / `maestro delegate ... --role explore`. Never ask what code or memory can verify; never bounce your own ambiguity back to the user — search first, then ask only what truly needs human judgment.
- Writeback cadence: each time a decision settles, immediately append/update its row in `guidance-specification.md` §11 (create the section if absent). Do NOT batch writeback to the end — partial decisions must already be on disk before the next question.
- Branch jumps allowed: the user may switch freely between mode / role / upstream / sub-pipeline branches; sequence is not enforced, but every decision point must end with a definite answer.
- Scope guard: only ask about decisions owned by `brainstorm`. Do not pre-resolve roadmap/plan choices.

Decision points: mode (auto / single-role / review-only) / role selection and `--count` / `--from` upstream source / whether to enable design-research and the DESIGN.md sub-pipeline.

Exit: on consensus or explicit user signal to proceed, finalize session metadata. The §11 table (already populated incrementally) uses this schema:
`| # | Decision | Choice | Source (user / code / default) |`

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/brainstorm.md' completely.

**Next-step routing on completion:**

Auto mode:
- Project not initialized → view_file(AbsolutePath="<agy-skills-dir>/maestro-init/SKILL.md") + execute inline
- Project initialized, need formal spec package → view_file(AbsolutePath="<agy-skills-dir>/maestro-blueprint/SKILL.md") + execute inline (args: "--from brainstorm:{artifact_id}")
- Project initialized, quick roadmap → view_file(AbsolutePath="<agy-skills-dir>/maestro-roadmap/SKILL.md") + execute inline (args: "--from brainstorm:{artifact_id}")
- Need deeper analysis first → view_file(AbsolutePath="<agy-skills-dir>/maestro-analyze/SKILL.md") + execute inline (args: "{topic} --from brainstorm:{artifact_id}")
- `html-prototypes/` produced with 2+ files and user wants to browse → load `~/.maestro/workflows/brainstorm-visualize.md` and launch visualizer server (optional, user-triggered)
- DESIGN.md established during Step 3.5 → suggest: "Run `/maestro-impeccable build <feature-description>` to build with the established design system"

Single role mode:
- More roles needed → view_file(AbsolutePath="<agy-skills-dir>/maestro-brainstorm/SKILL.md") + execute inline (args: "{next_role} --session {session_id}")
- All roles done, run synthesis → view_file(AbsolutePath="<agy-skills-dir>/maestro-brainstorm/SKILL.md") + execute inline (args: "{topic} --session {session_id}")

- [ ] If zero findings: final report explicitly states "No cross-role issues detected"; guidance §12 unchanged

- [ ] Session metadata updated with completion status (review_findings_count, resolutions_applied, patches_skipped)

**Single role mode**:
- [ ] `{role}/analysis.md` written with §2 Decision Digest + §4 File Index
- [ ] `{role}/analysis-F-*.md` written when guidance §10 feature list available
- [ ] §2 Decisions table references guidance decision IDs
