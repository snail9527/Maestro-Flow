<purpose>
Perform multi-dimensional analysis of a technical proposal, decision, or architecture choice through iterative CLI-assisted exploration and interactive discussion. Produces a discussion timeline (discussion.md) with evolving understanding, multi-perspective findings, Decision Recording Protocol, Intent Coverage tracking, and a final conclusions package with Go/No-Go recommendation.

Combines structured 6-dimension scoring with iterative deepening and decision extraction. Replaces both analysis and decision-capture workflows — produces analysis.md (scoring) AND context.md (Locked/Free/Deferred decisions for plan).

Use `-q` for quick decision extraction only (skip exploration + scoring).

Use `--gaps` for issue-focused root cause analysis (replaces manage-issue-analyze). Loads issues from issues.jsonl, performs CLI exploration against issue context/location, synthesizes root cause into issue.analysis, and outputs context.md for downstream `plan --gaps`.

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- phase number for micro mode, topic text for macro/adhoc mode, no args for milestone-wide.

**Dual-layer mode:**
- **Macro mode** (text argument): Explore impact surface of a topic/requirement. Produces coarse-grained context with `scope_verdict` to route next step. Use before roadmap or for standalone analysis.
- **Micro mode** (numeric argument): Phase-level deep analysis within an existing roadmap. Produces fine-grained context for plan consumption. `analyze 1` = Phase 1 of current milestone.

**Disambiguation rule (mode selection):**
- First positional arg matches `^\d+$` (pure digits, e.g. `1`, `42`) → **micro mode** (treat as phase number)
- First positional arg is non-numeric text (e.g. `auth-refactor`, `improve search`) → **macro mode** (treat as topic)
- No positional arg → milestone-wide micro mode (when roadmap present) else macro fallback
- Mixed input like `"1 phase"` is treated as text → macro mode (only bare numerics trigger micro)

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes`: Auto mode — skip interactive scoping, use recommended defaults, auto-deepen
- `-c` / `--continue`: Resume from existing session (auto-detect session folder + discussion.md)
- `-q` / `--quick`: Quick mode — skip exploration + scoring, go straight to decision extraction (context.md only)
- `--from <source>`: Load upstream context package (brainstorm:ID, blueprint:BLP-xxx, @file, or path)
- `--gaps [ISS-ID]`: Issue root cause analysis mode. If ISS-ID provided, analyze single issue. If omitted, analyze all open/registered issues from issues.jsonl.

Scope routing, output directory format, artifact registration schema, and output artifact listing are defined in workflow analyze.md (Scope Routing and Output Structure sections).

### Role Knowledge
`maestro wiki list --category debug` → select relevant → `maestro wiki load`
</context>

<interview_protocol>
Interview the user relentlessly until shared understanding is reached. Active only in interactive mode; skip when `-y/--yes`, `-c/--continue`, or input is already specific (explicit phase number or unambiguous topic).

- One decision per turn via ask_question with 2–4 options + a (Recommended) default. The user controls termination — keep interviewing until convergence; they can interrupt naturally or via `Other` at any time.
- Search-first when uncertain: before asking, resolve via `state.json`, `roadmap.md`, `issues.jsonl`, `maestro spec load`, `maestro wiki search`, Grep, Read, or — for open-ended multi-file scans — spawn `invoke_subagent([{ TypeName: "<TypeName>", Role: "<Role>", Prompt: "<Prompt>", Workspace: "inherit" }])` / `maestro delegate ... --role explore`. Never ask what code or memory can verify; never bounce your own ambiguity back to the user — search first, then ask only what truly needs human judgment.
- Writeback cadence: each settled decision is immediately appended/updated in `discussion.md` (top table) and mirrored into `context.md` "Interview Decisions". Do NOT batch writeback to the end — partial decisions must already be on disk before the next question.
- Walk the decision dependency tree strictly: scope → depth → dimensions → Go/No-Go threshold. Do not open the next branch until the current one is settled.
- Scope guard: only ask about decisions owned by `analyze`. Do not prejudge plan/execute concerns.

Decision points: scope (phase / topic / milestone-wide / adhoc / --gaps) → depth (quick / standard / deep) → dimensions (which of the 6 to keep) → Go/No-Go threshold.

Exit: when all decision points are settled (or user explicitly signals to proceed), finalize session metadata. The decision table (populated incrementally during interview) uses this schema:
`| # | Decision | Choice | Source (user / code / default) |`
</interview_protocol>

<execution>
Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/analyze.md' completely.

### --gaps Mode (Issue Root Cause Analysis)

When `--gaps` flag is present, follow `~/.maestro/workflows/issue-gaps-analyze.md` instead of the standard analyze pipeline:

```
Phase 1: Load issues from .workflow/issues/issues.jsonl
  - If ISS-ID provided: load single issue
  - If no ISS-ID: filter issues where status = open | registered
  - Validate: at least 1 issue loaded, else error E_NO_ISSUES

Phase 2: CLI exploration per issue
  - For each issue: build exploration prompt from issue.title, description, context, related_files
  - Run maestro delegate --role analyze --mode analysis with codebase context
  - Gather affected files, call chains, root cause evidence

Phase 3: Root cause synthesis → write issue.analysis
  - Parse CLI output into analysis record: { root_cause, affected_files, impact_scope, fix_direction, confidence, analyzed_at, tool, depth }
  - Write analysis record to issue in issues.jsonl
  - Append history entry: { action: "analyzed", at: <ISO>, by: "maestro-analyze --gaps" }

Phase 4: Output context.md for downstream plan --gaps
  - Aggregate all analyzed issues into context.md with root causes and fix directions
  - Register ANL artifact in state.json
```

**Handoff:** context.md is consumed by maestro-plan (loads Locked/Free/Deferred decisions). In --gaps mode, context.md contains issue root causes for `plan --gaps` consumption.

**scope_verdict** (added to context.md in Step 6 Synthesis for macro/adhoc/standalone scopes):
- `large` (3+ independent subsystems or hard serial dependencies) → suggest `/maestro-roadmap --from analyze:ANL-xxx`
- `medium` (1-2 subsystems, parallelizable) → suggest `/maestro-plan --from analyze:ANL-xxx`
- `small` (single-file or few-file change) → suggest `/maestro-plan --from analyze:ANL-xxx`

**Next-step routing on completion:**

Phase/Milestone scope (micro mode):
- Go recommendation, UI work needed → `/maestro-impeccable build {target}`
- Go recommendation, ready to plan → `/maestro-plan` or `/maestro-plan {phase}`
- No-Go recommendation → revisit requirements or `/maestro-brainstorm {topic}`

Macro/Adhoc/Standalone scope:
- scope_verdict = large → `/maestro-roadmap --from analyze:ANL-xxx`
- scope_verdict = medium/small → `/maestro-plan --from analyze:ANL-xxx`
- Need more exploration → `/maestro-analyze {topic} -c`

Gaps scope:
- Issues analyzed → `/maestro-plan --gaps` (plan fix tasks linked to issues)
- Need more context → `/maestro-analyze --gaps {ISS-ID}` (re-analyze specific issue)
