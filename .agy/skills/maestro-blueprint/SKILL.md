<purpose>
Formal specification document chain producing a complete specification package through 6 sequential phases with multi-CLI analysis and interactive refinement. Pure documentation — no code generation, no roadmap generation.

Parallel to `brainstorm` as an upstream origin command:
- **brainstorm** = divergent exploration (lightweight, multi-role creative)
- **blueprint** = convergent documentation (heavyweight, 6-phase formal spec chain)

Output: `.workflow/blueprint/BLP-{slug}-{date}/` containing Product Brief, PRD, Architecture, and Epics.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
@~/.maestro/workflows/blueprint.md
</required_reading>

<deferred_reading>
- [blueprint-config.json](~/.maestro/templates/blueprint-config.json) — read when initializing blueprint configuration
</deferred_reading>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS -- idea text, @file reference, or upstream context source.

**Flags:**
- `-y` / `--yes`: Auto mode — skip interactive questions, use recommended defaults
- `-c` / `--continue`: Resume from last checkpoint (reads blueprint-config.json)
- `--from <source>`: Load upstream context package (brainstorm:ID, @file, or path). Consumes context-package.json
- `--from-brainstorm SESSION-ID`: (backward compat alias for `--from brainstorm:ID`)

**Input types:**
- Direct text: `"Build a real-time collaboration platform with WebSocket"`
- File reference: `@requirements.md`
- Context import: `--from brainstorm:BRN-001` or `--from @requirements.md` or `--from path/`
- Resume: `-c` (resumes from first incomplete phase)

**Pipeline position:**
```
maestro-brainstorm (optional upstream)
        ↓ guidance-specification.md / context-package.json
maestro-blueprint
        ↓ .workflow/blueprint/BLP-{slug}-{date}/
maestro-analyze → maestro-roadmap → maestro-plan
```

**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target `.workflow/blueprint/BLP-{slug}-{date}/` or `.workflow/state.json` only. NEVER modify source code or files outside these paths.

### Pre-load specs
1. **Architecture specs**: Run `maestro spec load --category arch` to load architecture constraints. Use as context for architecture decisions (Phase 4).
2. Optional — proceed without if unavailable.
</context>

<interview_protocol>
Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the spec until shared understanding is reached. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one; if a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead. Active only in interactive mode; skip when `-y/--yes`, `-c/--continue`, or input is already specific (clear idea + scope).

- Ask one question per turn via ask_question and wait for the user's feedback before continuing; every question must carry a recommended answer marked `(Recommended)`, 2–4 options total. The user controls termination — keep interviewing until convergence; they can interrupt naturally or via `Other` at any time.
- Search-first when uncertain: before asking, resolve via `state.json`, existing artifacts, `maestro spec load`, direct codebase exploration (Glob/Grep/Read), or — for open-ended multi-file scans — spawn `invoke_subagent([{ TypeName: "<TypeName>", Role: "<Role>", Prompt: "<Prompt>", Workspace: "inherit" }])` / `maestro delegate ... --role explore`. Never ask what code or memory can verify; never bounce your own ambiguity back to the user — search first, then ask only what truly needs human judgment.
- Writeback cadence: each settled decision is immediately persisted into `blueprint-config.json` before the next question. Do NOT batch writeback to the end — partial decisions must already be on disk.
- Walk the decision dependency tree depth-first: scope → spec type → focus areas → requirement priorities. Do not open the next branch until the current one is settled.
- Scope guard: only decide the shape of the specification. Do not pre-resolve roadmap phases or plan tasks — those belong to downstream commands.

Decision points: scope (full product / feature set / single feature) → spec type (service / api / library / platform) → focus areas → whether to run codebase exploration.

Exit: on consensus or explicit user signal to proceed, finalize blueprint-config.json (decisions already written incrementally) and proceed to Phase 1.

### Phase chain

```
P0: Spec Study → P1: Discovery → P1.5: Req Expansion → P2: Product Brief → P3: PRD → P4: Architecture → P5: Epics → P6: Readiness Check
```

P6 gate: Pass (>=80%) → Handoff | Review (60-79%) → Handoff w/caveats | Fail (<60%) → P6.5 Auto-Fix (max 2 iter) → re-check

### Next-step routing on completion

| Ready for roadmap | /maestro-roadmap --from blueprint:BLP-xxx |
| Small scope, direct plan | /maestro-plan --from blueprint:BLP-xxx |
| Need project setup | /maestro-init |
</execution>

| W001 | warning | CLI analysis failed, using fallback | Continue with available data |
| W002 | warning | Codebase exploration failed | Continue without codebase context |
